They were testing Gov. Andrew Cuomo's vow to enforce the curfew there.\nState troopers arrested 26 Saturday and 13 Sunday night, including four who also were arrested a day earlier.\nAll were issued appearance tickets for Albany City Court, though District Attorney P. David Soares says he won't prosecute them for trespassing.\nDemonstrators say they will keep challenging the curfew until the arrests stop and they expect a large group to do that this weekend.\n \nLOAD-DATE: November 15, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newswire\nCopyright 2011 Associated Press\nAll Rights Reserved", "topics": [{"id": "1", "questions": [{"text": "What did the crowd block?", "top": false, "answers": [{"text": "Street", "id": "1.02.02"}, {"text": "Public transportation", "id": "1.02.03"}, {"text": "Sidewalk", "id": "1.02.01"}, {"text": "Airport", "id": "1.02.04"}, {"text": "Shipping port", "id": "1.02.05"}], "dependencies": [], "type": "mc", "id": "1.02"}, {"text": "What type of event did the protesters disrupt?", "top": false, "answers": [{"text": "Politician's speech", "id": "1.03.02"}, {"text": "City council meeting", "id": "1.03.03"}, {"text": "Political campaign", "id": "1.03.01"}, {"text": "Auction", "id": "1.03.04"}], "dependencies": [{"then": "1.04", "if": "1.03"}], "type": "mc", "id": "1.03"}, {"text": "What type of event is described in the highlighted text?", "top": true, "answers": [{"text": "Rally/Demonstration", "id": "1.01.02"}, {"text": "Strike", "id": "1.01.03"}, {"text": "March/Parade", "id": "1.01.01"}, {"text": "Moving a camp to a new location", "id": "1.01.06"}, {"text": "Disrupting an on-going event of the perceived 1%", "id": "1.01.07"}, {"text": "Blocking Action", "id": "1.01.04"}, {"text": "Establishing a Camp", "id": "1.01.05"}, {"text": "Divestment Action", "id": "1.01.08"}, {"text": "Voluntary Dissolution of a camp", "id": "1.01.09"}, {"text": "Strategic Sabotage", "id": "1.01.11"}, {"text": "Strategic Violence", "id": "1.01.10"}], "dependencies": [{"then": "1.02", "if": "1.01.04"}, {"then": "1.03", "if": "1.01.07"}, {"then": "1.05", "if": "1.01.10"}, {"then": "1.06", "if": "1.01.11"}], "type": "dd", "id": "1.01"}, {"text": "What type of strategic sabotage occurred?", "top": false, "answers": [{"text": "Pre-planned arson", "id": "1.06.02"}, {"text": "Pre-planned vandalism", "id": "1.06.01"}], "dependencies": [], "type": "mc", "id": "1.06"}, {"text": "What is the position or title of the 1% who is being protested against?", "top": false, "answers": [{"text": "City mayor", "id": "1.04.02"}, {"text": "City council member", "id": "1.04.03"}, {"text": "CEO of some company", "id": "1.04.01"}, {"text": "State legislature", "id": "1.04.04"}, {"text": "U.S. president", "id": "1.04.05"}], "dependencies": [], "type": "mc", "id": "1.04"}, {"text": "What type of strategic violence occurred?", "top": false, "answers": [{"text": "Assassination", "id": "1.05.02"}, {"text": "Bombing", "id": "1.05.03"}, {"text": "Kidnapping", "id": "1.05.01"}, {"text": "Assault", "id": "1.05.04"}], "dependencies": [], "type": "mc", "id": "1.05"}], "name": "Event type"}, {"id": "3", "questions": [{"text": "Exactly how many arrests occurred during the event?
