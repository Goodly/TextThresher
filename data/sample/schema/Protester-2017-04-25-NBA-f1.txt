glossary: blocking action: protesters intentionally block access to transportation or commercial infrastructure. E.g. protesters block access to government buildings, streets, sidewalks, light rail systems, bank buildings, shipping ports, etc.
 
glossary: camp: 
 
glossary: community response:
 
glossary: counter-protester: individual protesting against the occupy movement
  
glossary: disrupting an on-going event of the perceived 1%: protesters disrupt an event held by people they oppose eg protesters shout down politician who is speaking, intentionally disrupt city council meeting, or interrupt the proceedings of a fundraiser, etc.

glossary: march/parade: protesters move along a path usually chanting and holding signs. Note: if protesters spend time at their starting point or destination listening to speeches or musicians, that should be counted as a rally (an event separate from the march/parade).
 
glossary: moving a camp to a new location: protesters pack up tents and structures and leave the site of their encampment and establish a camp at a new location. Note: if only some campers leave the original camp the event should be categorized as the establishment of a new camp. (NOTE: implies the dissolution of the previous camp, so only count it as a move if the other camp is dissolving in the process. if the old camp survives while some of the people move to a new location, the move to a new location should simply be coded as the establishment of a new camp.)
  
glossary: rally/demonstration: protesters stay in one spot while listening to speeches or musicians, chanting, carrying signs, etc.
 
glossary: strategic violence: protesters carry out a pre-planned act of violence against other humans eg. Kidnapping, bombing, assassination, assault. Note: only use this classification for the event if it is clear that the highlighted text describes activities that were planned in advance.
  
glossary: strategic sabotage: protesters carry out pre-planned act of destruction of physical property eg vandalism, setting fires, breaking windows, etc. Note: only use this classification for the event if it is clear that the highlighted text describes activities that were planned in advance.

glossary: voluntary dissolution of a camp: protesters pack up tents and structures and leave the site of their encampment without being directly forced by police officers.
