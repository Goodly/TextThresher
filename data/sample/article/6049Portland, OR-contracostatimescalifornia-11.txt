<Useless>3 a.m. Protesters block two APL terminals/>
<Useless>About 150 protesters remained through the night and are now blocking two APL terminals. Workers are unable to enter and some are arguing with protesters./>
<Useless>A van carrying some Oakland police officers drove by and checked out the scene, but there was no police activity otherwise./>
<Useless>10:35 p.m. Mayor Jean Quan calls protest 'economic violence'/>
<Useless>Oakland Mayor Jean Quan blasted the port actions today as "economic violence" and questioned the motives of protesters who are threatening to disrupt another shift Tuesday morning./>
<Useless>"While we have not had physical violence, the economic violence to this city is just not fair," Quan said at a press briefing Monday evening. "... A small group of people are going to hold this port, this city, this economy hostage. It's not fair to the workers. It is not fair to this city. This city has been very generous to the 99 percent movement. This city has been very supportive."/>
<Useless>She called on protesters to "think about the consequences" of their protest, especially as a group is threatening to shut down a 3 a.m. shift./>
<Useless>"The people who are planning to stay at the port -- do they have families who have trucks that because of the slowdown in the economy may lose those trucks? A day's pay -- $600, $700 -- could be the difference as to whether they can keep that truck or not./>
<Useless>"People have to think about who are they hurting. They are saying, 'We want to get the attention of the ruling class.' Well, I think the ruling class is probably laughing, and people in this city will be crying this Christmas. It's really got to stop."/>
<Useless>Interim Police Chief Howard Jordon reminded demonstrators that "while peaceful forms of expression and free speech rights will be facilitated, acts of violence, property destruction and overnight lodging will not be tolerated."/>
<Useless>Port of Oakland officials said that terminals are sticking to their regular schedules with no truck or gate operations planned for Monday night./>
<Useless>Quan urged participants in the protests to respect workers who are trying to get home from the port and maintain safety and security, and avoid violence or damage to maritime area facilities./>
<Useless>10 p.m. Crowd moves to APL Terminal/>
<Useless>About 200 remaining protesters have migrated from the Hanjin terminal on Middle Harbor Road to the APL terminal. Three tents have been pitched in the road, and protesters are eating and relaxing while still vowing to wait and regroup for a planned shut down of the 3 a.m. shift at some terminals./>
<Useless>9:30 p.m. Less than 100 remain at Hanjin terminal/>
<Useless>At the Port of Oakland, the mood is festive as people dance to music from a truck with a sound system, chat and mill around. Many are now walking east down Middle Harbor Road out of the port and say they plan to go home to eat, sleep and warm up and the return at 1:30 a.m. to gear up for a 3 a.m. blockage. It's not clear how many plan to do that./>
<Useless>Meanwhile, organizers are directing people to go to the APL terminal near the Adeline bridge and for supporters to bring supplies there. Organizers say they plan a march from 7th and Adeline streets at 12:45 a.m./>
<Useless>8:50 p.m. Mayor Jean Quan speaks out against continuing protest/>
<Useless>At a press briefing earlier, Mayor Jean Quan said she had planned to thank everyone for being peaceful, until she found out that protesters planned to continue blocking the Port of Oakland into Tuesday morning./>
<Useless>"The economic violence is just not fair," she said. "The people who are planning to stay at the port, do they have family who have trucks? ... People have to think about who they are hurting./>
<Useless>"I think the 1 percent are probably laughing and people in this city are crying," Quan said./>
<Useless>Interim Police Chief Howard Jordan said police plan to monitor protesters' activity Monday evening and into Tuesday morning and take "appropriate action" at the right time./>
<Useless>Regular activity continues inside the port, but with no unloading or trucking, said Port of Oakland Executive Director Omar Benjamin./>
<Useless>There are three ships berthed at the port that were not unloaded Monday because of the strike; the plan is to unload them Tuesday, he said./>
<Useless>"Operations at the port's seven terminals experienced disruptions and delays," Benjamin said. "(Monday's) disruptions have been costly to port workers and their families."/>
<Useless>Oakland police had not yet made any mutual aid calls Monday, Jordan said. However, some Alameda County Sheriff's deputies were called in advance to assist. The city will pay those costs, he said./>
<Useless>8:15 p.m. Protesters asking for help, supplies, food, blankets/>
<Useless>About 1,000 protesters remain at the Port, but only about 100 have indicated that they are willing to stay until 3 a.m. to try and shutdown the early morning shift. Protesters have put out a call to supporters asking for warm clothes, food and blankets as they continue the protest into the night and early hours of the morning./>
<Useless>Meanwhile, reporters at the Hanjin terminal are having trouble finding people willing to be interviewed by what they call the "corporate media." One radio reporter says a protester urinated on the news van, then swore at them while telling them to "get lost."/>
<Useless>7:45 p.m. General assembly decides to block 3 a.m. shift/>
<Useless>The Occupy Oakland general assembly has decided, without a vote, to continue the Port of Oakland blockage for the 3 a.m. Tuesday shift. The decision was based on claims that Occupy movements on the West Coast faced arrests and stun grenades Monday./>
<Useless>However, many Occupy protesters appear not willing to stay until 3 a.m. The group is now attempting to determine how many people want to stay and how many want to leave./>
<Useless>7 p.m. Trucks being loaded at Howard Terminal/>
<Useless>While Port of Oakland activity seems halted elsewhere, work is still under way at one Port of Oakland terminal. Workers are loading and unloading trucks at the Howard Terminal near Jack London Square. At the Hanjin Terminal, the Occupy Oakland group is holding its general assembly to decide whether to extend the blockade until 3 a.m. Tuesday./>
<Useless>Meanwhile, Port of Oakland and city officials will brief the media about the day's events at 8 p.m./>
<Useless>6 p.m. General assembly to decide on blockade/>
<Useless>A large crowd has gathered at Hanjin shipping, terminals 55 and 66. A general assembly will be held to determine whether to extend the port blockade until the next shift, at 3 a.m./>
<Useless>There's a dozen trucks waiting to get in; the first one has a load of meat from Kansas. Its driver, Lee Ranaldson, said he'd probably lost $1,000 today./>
<Useless>"The ones they are fighting against are at home. They already made their money today," he said./>
<Useless>5:30 p.m. People climb atop semitrucks/>
<Useless>The march has arrived at the Hanjin terminal. There's a line of blocked semi trucks in the middle of the road, and a half dozen people have climbed on top of one of them. There are seven TV trucks and helicopters, but still no police presence./>
<Useless>5:15 p.m. Fireworks at port/>
<Useless>As people march through the port, a small fireworks display briefly lit up the night. Otherwise, there appears to be little activity in the terminals./>
<Useless>4:55 p.m. Protesters arrive at Port of Oakland/>
<Useless>As three helicopters hover overhead, thousands of protesters are entering the port, a much larger crowd than there was at the early morning action. One group of activists is carrying a tent, and there's three helicopters overhead. There's no immediate sign of police./>
<Useless>4:30 p.m. A lively procession/>
<Useless>The march to West Oakland, now perhaps 1,000 strong, is turning onto Adeline. Music is blasting from a flatbed truck that was rented for the occasion. People are playing drums and dancing, about six blocks deep./>
<Useless>4:10 p.m. The march begins/>
<Useless>Hundreds of protesters have left Frank Ogawa Plaza for the Port of Oakland, chanting, "Whose street? Our street."/>
<Useless>Organizers are on a flatbed truck with a sound system. A band on the sidewalk is playing "Rage Against the Machine."/>
<Useless>3:45 p.m. Davis, Olsen speak at rally/>
<Useless>Civil rights activist Angela Davis is helping to get protesters warmed up before the 4 p.m. march to the port. Scott Olsen, a 24-year-old Iraq War veteran who suffered a serious head injury when protesters said he was hit with a tear-gas canister during a clash with police in October, also addressed the crowd./>
<Useless>"It's a great day to be out here for my first event," Olsen said. "I look forward to marching with you and joining you once again. ... Stay peaceful, stay safe, and let's do some real action."/>
<Useless>Hundreds of people are gathered at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza in front of Oakland City Hall./>
<Useless>3:30 p.m. Organizers to crowd: Bring your sleeping bags tonight/>
