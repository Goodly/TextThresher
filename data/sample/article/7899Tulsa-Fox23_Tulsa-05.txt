<Protester>Occupy Tulsa rallied/><Strategy> in support of an accused hit man’s constitutional rights /><Protester>Thursday evening. />
<Strategy>Terrico Bethel is accused of gunning down Tulsa businessman Neal Sweeney at his east Tulsa office, in September of 2008. It’s a hit prosecutors say was planned by Mohammad Aziz, />a north Tulsa gas station owner, who didn't want to pay Sweeney for fuel delivery.


Usually occupiers are out at<Camp> Centennial Green near 6/><Camp>th/><Camp> and Main Street, />but<Protester> for a few hours close to 50 people stood outside the David L. Moss Correctional Center/> unafraid of backlash <Protester>this rally/> could bring their way.
<Strategy>Occupiers say this not about whether Bethel is guilty or innocent. />
<Strategy>“I know for a fact he has rights that are being denied of him,”/><Camp> Chris Nichols said./>
When asked to elaborate, Nichols said, <Strategy>“it’s not necessarily right that he’s been detained for what’s been going on three years.”/>
Supporting Bethel’s sixth amendment right to a speedy trial is a move that’s sure to fire up the opposition.  It’s something not even Bethel’s mother expected.
<Strategy>“(I was) very shocked, very surprised, very pleased, I mean, I am still kind of overwhelmed by it,” Glenda Gray said./>


The people behind Occupy Tulsa say their mission is broader than just eliminating corporate greed in Tulsa and across the globe.
<Opinionor>“We’re willing to devote what resources we have to social justice,” Nichols said./>
<Opinionor>No matter whom Nichols says they offend, inspire, or alarm./>
<Opinionor>“We have the obligation as a society to advocate for justice whether or not we are socially degraded for it.”/>
They just want Bethel out of a jail cell and into a court room.
<Strategy>“If he is connected to the crime, and if he did commit the murder he should experience that due process,” />Nichols told FOX23.
District Attorney Tim Harris wouldn’t comment on camera, but he says the reason Bethel’s trial keeps getting delayed is that Bethel has had repeated issues with his lawyers.
Bethel’s mother however says her son’s first lawyer left the case after more complicated charges were added, and a second lawyer left when additional funds for the Bethel’s legal defense were not approved.


Court paperwork does show that six weeks ago, Bethel fired his attorney once again pushing his trial back. He is scheduled to be in court for a pretrial hearing on December 14th.
