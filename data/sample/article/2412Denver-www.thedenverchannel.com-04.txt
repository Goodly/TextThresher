<Camp>A man accused of setting fires at an Occupy Denver protest has been charged with arson./>
Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey said that 22-two-year-old Michael Clapper, of Westminster, was charged with four counts of fourth-degree arson on Thursday.
<Police>Clapper, of Westminster, allegedly set fire to a structure and other debris in Civic Center Park on Monday. That's when police moved in to clear out the nearby sidewalk that had served as the hub for the Occupy movement. Some makeshift structures had been erected there and some went up in flames as police closed in./>
A photo in The Denver Post shows Clapper and another unidentified protester holding a pizza box that's on fire in a trash can.
Clapper was being held in jail. It's not known if he has a lawyer.
<Police>Eight other people were arrested during the clearing out of Occupy Denver. District attorney's spokeswoman Lynn Kimbrough said most are accused of less serious offenses, such as failure to listen to police, and will likely be ticketed./>
