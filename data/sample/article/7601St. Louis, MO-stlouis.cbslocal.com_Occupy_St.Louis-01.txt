ST. LOUIS (KMOX) -  <Info>Attorneys representing members of Occupy St. Louis are scheduled to be in a federal courtroom Tuesday morning./>
<Info>They’ll be seeking an injunction that would allow protestors to reestablish their tent city at Kiener Plaza, /><Protester>which protestors dubbed “Freedom Square” during their six-week stay there./>
<Info>Hearing the case will be U.S. District Judge Carol Jackson/>, <Legal_Action>who on Friday rejected a temporary restraining order filed on behalf of protestors because she wasn’t convinced that evicting them violated the protestors’ First Amendment right to free speech./>
Occupy St. Louis attorney Maggie Ellinger-Locke said <Police>Friday’s sweep and arrests, />however, proved their point.
<Police>“Twenty-seven people were arrested,”/> she pointed out.  <Government>“Many, many tents and other materials were confiscated and put into a dump truck./> <Strategy>This clearly has harmed their constitutional right to freedom of speech.”/>
Meantime, all of those arrested during that sweep for <Government>violating the city’s 10 pm curfew />are now out of jail.
KMOX News caught up with Occupy member Jonathon Wilson outside the city jail as he was working on bail arrangements.
“We’re not giving up no matter how many arrests they make, no matter how hard their pushed,” he vowed.  “We plan on sticking it out until our cause, not just here in St. Louis but worldwide, is met.”

<Useless>Coded first part as orange to denote camp establishment. Assumption is that police warning on first day is part of the protester-initiated event of setting up tents. />
<Useless>Second part is coded as blue because the same thing happens the next night, when the camp has already been established. It is, therefore, a police-initiated event (because the camp already exists)./>
