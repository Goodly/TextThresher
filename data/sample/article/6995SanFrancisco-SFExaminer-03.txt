It was only a matter of time until the Occupy Wall Street movement came to one of the nation’s most renowned bastions of protest, and the local effort appears to be growing.
<Camp>The so-called “General Assembly” of the Occupy SF movement/> has <Protester>built a growing makeshift camp on Market Street this week/> and <Info>plan a march to the Federal Reserve Bank at noon today./> <Protester>The group began as a /><Camp>gathering of roughly 10 people/><Protester> camping/>
<Protester>outside the Bank of America building on California Street on Sept. 17,/> t<Useless>he same day the flagship encampment was set up in Zuccotti Park, two blocks north of Wall Street in New York./>

<Useless>The Occupy Wall Street protests have spread from Los Angeles to Boston; Chicago; Portland, Maine, and other cities. The budding anti-Wall Street movement began last month with a vague sense of grievance over the widening gap between the rich and poor in America./>
<Useless>But in three weeks, it has provided fuel for a broader national message of financial despair. Protesters have spoken out about the lack of jobs and opportunities. Organizers in Washington, D.C., plan a march at Freedom Plaza on Thursday to “denounce the systems and institutions that support endless war and unrestrained corporate greed.”/>
<Useless>Brought together by social media outlets such as Twitter and Facebook, participants hope the New York protests can plant the seeds of a permanent national movement./>
<Protester>In San Francisco, protesters initially spent about a week at the Bank of America building at 555 California St. /><2><Protester>The group then moved to Union Square /></><Government>until they were asked to leave after about a day. /><3><Protester>That is when they began building a semipermanent camp on Market Street,/></> c<Camp>omplete with tents and a makeshift cooking area under a blue tarp held up between trees and bushes./>
<Camp>As of Tuesday afternoon, about 40 people were setting up for a rainy night/> and <Police>some protesters said police had already asked them to move. />Rob Benson, one of the protesters in his late 30s, said <Police>police asked them to get a permit from the Department of Public Works, then they were redirected to another city department, then back to the police./>
<Strategy>“You can’t permit the right to assemble,” />Benson said, adding that t<Strategy>he group is attempting to maintain good relations with police. “It’s a right.”/>
<Info>A poster being circulated by the group calls on protesters to show up at the Federal Reserve Building at noon today. />The material is being distributed on <Camp>the website/>
<Camp>occupysf.com, />which also is <Camp>encouraging people to bring supplies for long-term camping, plus gardening equipment, art supplies, baby wipes and kiddie pools. The site also asks protesters to bring solar-powered chargers and smartphones with tethering capabilities to give the group roaming Internet access./>
<Camp>The scene Tuesday included casual interaction, tambourine playing, marijuana smoking and other fanfare. Tarek Mejri, 34, was cooking up a big pot of vegetable pasta, which he said was donated by a local farmers market./>
<Camp>“Everything you see here is donated,”/> Mejri said.
