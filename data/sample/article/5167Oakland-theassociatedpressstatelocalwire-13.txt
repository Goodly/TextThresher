DATELINE: OAKLAND Calif.
Occupy Oakland protesters plan to set up tents at another downtown site less
than a week after their encampment in front of City Hall was taken down.
The demonstrators say they will erect tents at a park and unused lot in the
city's revitalized Uptown district as part of a Day of Action on Saturday.
The park is home to a recently-installed monument that features the sculptures
of 25 prominent humanitarians, including Martin Luther King, Jr., Cesar Chavez,
Mother Teresa and Mahatma Gandhi.
Mayor Jean Quan said in statement on Thursday that any camping on city property
is illegal. She said police have a strategy to prevent any potential encampment
by Occupy Oakland members.
