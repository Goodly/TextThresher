<Camp>Baltimore Police say a 24-year-old woman was stabbed during a dispute around midnight Saturday at the Occupy Baltimore encampment at the Inner Harbor./>
According to a police report, officers arrived at McKeldin Square just after midnight for a report of an assault and spoke to the victim, who said she and 23-year-old Desiree Nicholson had gotten into an argument “because (Nicholson) was not taking care of her cat,” according to report.
She said Nicholson kicked her in the stomach, and then stabbed her on her arm and thigh with a knife. The victim was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital for treatment, police said.
Nicholson, who police said lives in Halethorpe, was charged with first-degree assault and was being held on $75,000 bond. According to court records, she does not have a prior criminal record.

Organizer Annemarie Rush said the victim and suspect have been staying at the site for “quite some time, but they are not considered to be active participants in our greater goals.”
“We have attracted a wide array of different parts of Baltimore, and different people who feel they have been disenfranchised,” Rush said. “That also includes all of the problems that come with Baltimore and society in general.”
She said organizers were “horrified” by the stabbing and said the suspect was not welcome back. "We don’t condone their actions at all,” she said.

Rush said organizers have no plan to leave. “This is just the first step in the Occupy movement,” she said.
An earlier version of this article quoted organizers saying the victim and suspect were still welcome at the encampment. Rush said that is not the case.
