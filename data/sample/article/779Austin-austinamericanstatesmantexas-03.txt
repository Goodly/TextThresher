The show: Occupy Austin
The scene: Early evening on a recent weekday at Austin City Hall
The cast: <Camp>More than 150 college kids, business owners, teachers, homeless people, waiters and so on/>
The plot: Motley crew of protesters tries to run a meeting. Chaos ensues.
Bonus plot: The whole thing unfolds on social media
Nobody said running an occupation was easy. From the gay rights movement to the Vietnam War protests, the messy task of trying to change the world has been well-documented in books, movies, scholarly papers and academic research.
But these days, people don't have to wait for the postgame commentary. Thanks to social media, they can watch every detail of the Wall Street protests unfold for themselves. <Camp>Occupy Austin is, in a way, a reality show produced by Facebook, Twitter, Livestream, blogs, Google groups and email. />And what viewers are seeing ranges from high drama and fierce divisions to hard work and unexpected kindness.
Whether Occupy protests go boom or bust, one thing is clear: Trying to pull off a social movement is a complicated, time-consuming, often-frustrating business.
<Opinionor>"It's a wonderful process," said Sylvia Benini , one of Occupy Austin's organizers. "It's like the birth of a child. It has to grow."/>
Episode 1: Coming together
The scene: Late morning on a weekday at a small warehouse in East Austin
The cast:<Camp> About a dozen volunteers, ranging in age from teens to middle-aged/>
The plot: <Camp>Protesters gather at headquarters to eat, sleep and handle logistical issues./>
<Camp>Base camp for Occupy Austin is a borrowed building cluttered with tools, tents, battered furniture, old computer monitors, bedding and more. A makeshift kitchen houses a sink, a counter and a mini-refrigerator. A small room at the front of the warehouse serves as the computer center, and another stores food donations./>
<Camp>"We've spent $50 on food," said volunteer Chris Nielsen ,/> a 32-year-old Austin man who owns a golf cart taxi company.<Camp> "Whatever we need, we just put it out on Twitter or Facebook, and it just appears."/>
Occupy Austin is one of hundreds of spinoffs from <Useless>Occupy Wall Street, an ongoing protest in New York City that opposes, among other things, corporate money in politics and the growing wealth gap. Since the New York rallies began Sept. 17, protests have spread to more than 1,500 cities across the nation and world, including Paris and Rome ./>
<Useless>Protesters complain about different things, but their core belief is generally the same: Government favors the rich and oppresses the middle class and poor./>
<Opinionor>"It's always the little guy that gets stepped on," Nielsen said./>
<Protester>The Austin movement began to gel Sept. 29 , when about 500 people flocked to the coffeehouse Ruta Maya on South Congress Avenue to talk about the protests. /><Camp>Volunteers spent the next week planning an Oct. 6 rally at City Hall. Work groups, or "magnets," tackled city ordinances, food, legal advice, labor union outreach and other details./>
<Camp>There were no official leaders, no president, no board of directors. Proposals came from the magnets and were voted on at the twice-daily general assemblies./>
<Protester>That first protest drew more than 1,000 people./> But since then, Occupy Austin's public face has looked a little ragged. <Camp>During the day at City Hall - where protesters have set up a 24/7 occupation - signs generally outnumber people./>
But a closer look at the movement shows more. <Camp>About 100 people regularly show up for general assemblies. /><2><Protester>More than 1,000 people participated Saturday in a march to Chase Bank./></>
<Camp>Occupy Austin's website, which the U.S. Library of Congress has decided to archive with its Internet materials on public policy topics, has gotten more than 1.1 million hits./>
<Camp>Its Facebook page has more than 14,000 followers. It is developing an online radio station./>
And unlike many other groups, including Occupy Wall Street itself, <Opinionor>Occupy Austin has a concrete list of demands for the government, such as limits on corporate contributions to political campaigns and tax reform so "corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes."/>
<Opinionor>"This thing is coming together," said Occupy Austin member Peter Morales , a general contractor participating in the protest. "It's evolving every day."/>
Episode 2
Nuts and bolts
The scene: The general assembly on a recent weeknight at Austin City Hall
The cast: Harried facilitator, angry poet, sacred prayer lady, more than 100 protesters
The plot: Calm meeting quickly spins out of control
The light was fading, but tempers were rising.
<Camp>A meeting that had begun with a rational discussion about future events morphed into an argument over police oppression./>
<Camp>An angry poet grabbed the microphone to vent. A woman stood up to sing a sacred prayer. A competing group crooned a different song. The meeting facilitator succumbed to the chaos./>
<Camp>"I think that this meeting cannot be facilitated," she said, her voice trailing off./>
<Camp>You didn't have to be there to see it. The whole thing was broadcast on Livestream.com./>
<Camp>Every day, twice a day, Occupy Austin protesters meet on the plaza to discuss their plans for the movement. Until recently, the assemblies had a loose structure that left the agenda to be determined by the group, and that wasn't working, Benini said./>
<Camp>That night, organizers regrouped, switching up the meeting format to committee updates, announcements and an open forum that takes place in smaller groups without a microphone. Since then, meetings have been more constructive, but they are hardly conflict-free./>
<Camp>"You suck!" one man screamed at a speaker last week. "Shut up! I am your personal heckler!"/>
<Camp>Similar divisions have erupted online. In one recent incident on the Occupyaustin.org forums, someone posted an angry exchange between two people. The site moderator deleted it, generating fierce criticism./>
<Camp>"That thread should not have been deleted!!" one person wrote. "I just posted on it and we were all voicing our opinions and in no way should it have been deleted. THAT IS GOING TO DIVIDE US!!!"/>
<Camp>Censorship has been a recurring theme of complaints. Critics charge that Facebook posts questioning the movement regularly disappear./>
<Camp>Anton Montoya, who works for a local e-commerce business and is a member of Occupy Austin's Web team, said organizers are not deleting anything off Facebook and missing posts have likely been removed by the spam filter./>
<Camp>Moderators are, however, deleting posts off Occupy austin.org that the Web team deems hate speech or personal attacks./>
<Camp>"We will not allow that on the pages we are responsible for," Benini said. "That is called being responsible to our community."/>
<Useless>Austin isn't the only area to face such conflicts. Earlier this week, news stories detailed arguments within Occupy Wall Street in New York over issues such as diversity and strategy. /><Camp>And though things have improved, Occupy Houston's early demonstrations were frozen when participants argued so much that they couldn't decide where to march, said member Joshua Pineda, 25, a Houston resident who recently joined the Austin effort./>
<Camp>"The inexperience was massive amongst our ranks," he said./>
All of this, experts say, is typical of social movements. Friction is natural when trying to organize large groups of people, all of whom have their own perspectives and agendas.
The consequences of that friction vary, said Amin Ghaziani , an assistant professor in the sociology department of the University of British Columbia.
It can hurt recruitment or spur the creation of splinter groups, he said. It also leaves the movement vulnerable to a "divide and conquer" strategy by critics and the media who might seek to dilute the group's message, he said.
Series finale
or renewal?
But it's not all bad news.
"On the other hand, groups that are subjected to intense scrutiny and negative publicity often band together very tightly, clarify their message, and end up with a unit that is actually more cohesive because of the attention others pay to its internal disputes," Ghaziani said.
<Camp>The diversity of opinions within the group has also brought a diversity of resources, like business owners offering free food, welders building makeshift showers outside base camp and lawyers providing free legal advice. Many of the occupiers have developed strong friendships cultivated by working together 12 to 14 hours a day./>
<Camp>"I see people growing and respecting each other more and more," />said Ellis McClane , a 19-year-old online book seller. "It's a beautiful thing."
And so, for now, Occupy Austin is still writing new episodes for itself.
Whether the movement can continue to move forward is an open question. But Occupiers aren't going anywhere, said Tom Friedley, a 53-year-old radio broadcaster volunteering for the effort.
<Opinionor>"Right now, we're just going through growing pains," he said. "If this was easy, people would have done it by now."/>

<Useless>New York/>
<Useless> The global movement began here Sept. 17, when hundreds of people protested against Wall Street  profits in  Manhattan . About 150 people  stayed overnight in Zuccotti Park, a privately owned public space near Wall Street. Protesters have since sponsored  rallies and marches addressing financial inequity and other issues. More than 700 have been arrested as of Oct. 15./>
<Useless> Washington/>
<Useless> Occupy D.C. began Oct. 1 in McPherson Square, about two blocks from the White House. Some participants  clashed with police Oct. 8, which prompted the closure of the National Air and Space Museum. Occupy organizers said they've scaled back daily protests and have begun to hold 'teach-ins' on government corruption and money in politics./>
<Useless> Seattle/>
<Useless> On the West Coast, Seattle protesters have occupied Westlake Park and City Hall Plaza since late September; hundreds were routed and eight were arrested in the city Monday  after defying the city's ban on tents in public parks. At least 3,000 people marched Saturday  to Pike Place Market, where 200 sat down  on First Avenue and blocked traffic for about 10 minutes. Other Occupy protests/>
