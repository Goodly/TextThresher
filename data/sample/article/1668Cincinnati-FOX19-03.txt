Hundreds "Occupy Cincinnati"
CINCINNATI, OH (FOX19) -                         
<Protester>Hundreds gathered at Lytle Park Saturday morning to "Occupy Cincinnati."  /><2><Protester>The group then marched through downtown, and wound its way to Fountain Square/></><3><Protester> [ Fountain Square] where it had secured a permit to meet. Speakers, music, and rallying against corporate America were all included in the day's activities./></>
<Opinionor>A wide variety of signs supporting or protesting various causes could be seen, but Mardell Glinski-Schultz of Greenhills told Fox 19, "If you walk around and look at the signs, almost everybody brought out their own agenda, but I think that there is a common denominator and I think that common denominator is greed. It's the power of the corporations. The government is no longer for the people, and every one of these issues in its own separate way relates to that."/>
<Camp>According to occupycincinnati.org, />the group believes that 1% of the country's population has amassed 99% of the wealth. <Opinionor> Justin Jeffre attended the protest also, "We believe we have a duty to make this a better, more fair, equitable society. We have too much poverty. We have too much adult poverty and child poverty in this country and we're here to change that. We're here to demand change."/>
<Useless>Similar protests have spread from New York City to cities across the country, and beyond.  But critics of the group's message are speaking up, too.  In Washington D.C., House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said of the growing protests, "I for one am increasingly concerned about the growing mobs occupying Wall Street and the other cities across the country. And believe it or not, some in this town have actually condoned the pitting of Americans against Americans."/>
<Strategy>In Cincinnati, Hamilton County Republican Party Chair Alex Triantafilou tweeted Saturday, "I'm going to occupy my office so I can make a living."  He told Fox 19 that he completely understands that people are very frustrated with current economic conditions but he disagrees that corporate America should be their target, "We can bash corporations but some great corporations exist in our community and create lots of jobs so look, I understand the frustration about this but at the end of the day, corporations create jobs and that's important."/>
<Protester>It's estimated that about 500 people took part in the protest.  Cincinnati Police say it remained a peaceful one. /><3><Protester>[It's estimated that about 500 people took part in the protest.
