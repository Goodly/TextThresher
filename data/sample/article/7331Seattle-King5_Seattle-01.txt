Judge backs SCCC's move to evict Occupy Seattle camp

<Info>The group planned to march from Westlake to SCCC, where they set up camp./> This doesn't mean protesters won't still be at Westlake.
 "This (Westlake) is the epicenter, this is as close to our Wall Street as we've got," said Bob Barnes.
<Camp>Essentially, protesters will treat Westlake like their living room and the college as their bedroom, a place to rest. />[<2><Camp>Essentially, protesters will treat Westlake like their living room and the college as their bedroom, a place to rest.]/></>
<Protester>Teachers joined the movement on Saturday, protesting outside of Chase Bank./>
Teacher David Ehrich said with the Governor's mention of more cuts on the way, he has to speak his mind.
"We're cutting classes and classes and classes and the idea that we're going to cut more speaks to the fact that unless we change the revenue stream somewhere here in Washington, where we're taxing, we're never going to catch up," he said.
<Info>Protestors were readying for an 8 o'clock event at the college./>
