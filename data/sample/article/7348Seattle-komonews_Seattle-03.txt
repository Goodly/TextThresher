SEATTLE -- <Legal_Action>The protesters supporting the Occupy Seattle movement have submitted a list of demands to the mayor's office.

/><Legal_Action>The list includes five conditions under which the protesters would agree to move to City Hall Plaza for long-term occupancy as the mayor has suggested.
The protesters have demanded the approval of four large tents at the new location for use as a kitchen, an infirmary, a supply storage and an information center.
They also want at least one guaranteed parking space near City Hall Plaza that allows for around-the-clock parking, as well as permission to occupy their tents around the clock at the new location.
Also on the list of demands is 24-hour access to the first floor of City Hall for restroom access, and a written statement from the mayor approving the protesters' long-term occupancy of City Hall Plaza.








/>It was not clear when the mayor planned to respond to the list of demands, but a mayor's staff member said the office was reviewing the conditions.


<Legal_Action>Addressing the protesters on Monday, Seattle Mayor Mike McGinn said the group needed to "fight to get jobs, fight to get justice" as the effects of the Great Recession continue to hurt the area and the country.


/><Strategy>"Politicians of both parties, my party included, didn't have the guts to do anything about it," McGinn told the crowd. "This is my message to you. Keep organizing. Don't just fight to speak up...fight to get jobs, fight to get justice."
McGinn said the city would continue to the monitor the situation.




/>Not everybody is happy with the Westlake protests, with some businesses complaining that the crowds are scaring away customers and others upset about the noise. But McGinn and other officials have also been rapped for not being more accommodating. <Camp>Following such complaints, prominent local labor leaders have now sent a "letter of solidarity " to the movement and pledged to help out./>
