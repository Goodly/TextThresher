<Useless>Every night, Randy Stotts and four other homeless men head to the only place they feel safe - a patch of hard ground near the end of the 16th Street Mall where steel buffalo roam. Stotts and his friends bed down in sleeping bags and blankets near the bison sculptures between Larimer and Market streets - preferring the elements over a night in a shelter./>
<Useless>The men are a visible reminder of the increasing number of homeless people, a problem that is growing despite a city initiative started six years ago to end homelessness within a decade./>
<Useless>Though few could have predicted the economic crash that kicked people out of jobs and homes, Denver government and business leaders now are divided over how to solve the growing homeless problem. />
<Useless>Some lawmakers and business owners are pushing for tougher laws; others are seeking increased shelter space and more funding for services. The concern is that the current solution won't stop the number of homeless from growing and that next summer on the mall will be worse than this year./>
<Useless>Some worry that what is meant to be a safety net for Denver's most at-risk residents has also become a magnet for a steady stream of outsiders looking for help or a handout./>
<Useless>One councilman is suggesting busing homeless people out of the city and back to their families. And the city is pursuing an idea to fence off a park near the Denver Rescue Mission to keep drug dealers from preying on the homeless./>
<Useless>"We need to stand up for the businesses and residents downtown," said Councilman Charlie Brown. "We have been trying for a decade to get people to come downtown. And now this is standing in the way. This is a huge problem. We've got to come to grips with it, be fair and firm. Right now, it is all carrot and very little stick."/>
<Useless>Stotts and his friends say their misfortune has led them to the mall, where there are streetlights, safety in numbers and a steady police presence./>
<Useless>"There are some nights you shake pretty hard," Stotts said about the temperatures. "But I'm not worried about the cold. I am worried about the wet."/>
<Useless>Stotts, 46, is a self-proclaimed "hard-core alcoholic" who moved to Denver from New Mexico two years ago and is on a waiting list to get into a treatment program./>
<Useless>He spends his mornings at Skyline Park, sells the Voice newspaper in the afternoon and waits until 9 p.m. to head to the buffalo./>
<Useless>He is one of an estimated 500 chronically homeless people in the Denver metro area./>
<Useless>Stotts says he doesn't drink to get drunk, only to stop the shakes. Being drunk, out of control or passing out, he said, is like being a wounded animal in the wild - vulnerable./>
<Useless>Every night, Stotts bundles his belongings and wraps up in two sleeping bags, a blanket and a tarp to sleep on the mall./>
Numbers start to climb
<Government>The city has no law against people sleeping on downtown sidewalks between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. />But that may change as <Government>the mayor and council are discussing drafting new laws that could ban sleeping on the mall altogether or maybe even outlaw outdoor camping throughout the city./>
<Useless>This summer the number of homeless people camped overnight on the mall swelled to more than 100 a night - numbers not seen previously./>
<Useless>In the Denver metro area, 11,377 homeless men, women and children were counted Jan. 24 in the official point-in-time survey to assess the problem, the highest number since 2004 - although homeless advocates say the survey's methodology has changed./>
<Useless>About 62 percent of the homeless people counted in January were classified as being families with children. And about a quarter of the respondents were classified as "newly homeless."/>
<Useless>In 2005, Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper launched an initiative to end homelessness within a decade./>
<Useless>The so-called Denver's Road Home project focused on helping people find housing and get into programs to address underlying issues such as drug addiction, alcoholism or mental illness that often are the root cause of homelessness./>
<Useless>To date, Denver's Road Home has received more than $51 million in public and private funding, including grants and donations. That sum also includes about $6 million a year from Denver's Human Services budget./>
<Useless>"If you have spent any time at the housing facilities that have the wrap-around services, it is changing people's lives," said Denver Councilwoman Debbie Ortega./>
<Useless>Yet Denver's Road Home executive director Amber Callender, who last week announced her resignation, said the program has not been able to keep up with the demand that has grown since the 2008 economic crash./>
<Useless>As the numbers of homeless people have increased, shelter spaces have filled up, transitional housing has been taken and social-service programs have developed long waiting lists. At the same time, federal, state and local funding has been cut./>
<Useless>Next year, the program is losing two key grants - a $502,900 federal shelter grant and a $1.2 million emergency shelter grant under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act./>
<Useless>Despite the cuts and worsening problem, Callender says Denver's Road Home has been a success. Over the past six years, the program has added 2,373 housing units, connected 5,817 people with jobs, prevented 5,714 families from eviction and mentored more than 900 families and seniors out of homelessness, according to the city./>
<Useless>"The situation would have been so much worse had we not started six years ago," she said. "The 10-year plan is working very well. We have created a system where people are making a quick exit from homelessness."/>
<Useless>But this summer the visible problem of homelessness became hard to ignore./>
<Useless>On Aug. 25, outreach workers canvassed the 16th Street Mall to assess the problem. That night, they surveyed 136 people sleeping or hanging out on the mall./>
<Useless>Two-thirds of the respondents reported having substance-abuse problems, 90 people said they had previously been in jail, and half said they had mental-health issues./>
<Useless>"We are seeing an increase in the visibility of homeless partially due to the reduction in shelter space," said John Parvensky, chief executive of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless./>
<Useless>Two years ago, the Salvation Army's Crossroads Shelter eliminated 200 beds from the system./>
<Useless>In July, all of the 900 available shelter spaces had filled up. Some people set up camp on the South Platte River but were shooed away when notices went up advising them that it is against the law./>
Many of the displaced people went to the mall, where homeless people with their belongings staked out the best spots, and hundreds could be seen sleeping overnight. As cold weather approached, more beds opened up and<Camp> some homeless joined the Occupy Denver movement./>
<Useless>Criminalizing activity/>
<Useless>But complaints from merchants and tourists signaled that next summer could be an even bigger problem on the mall as the numbers of homeless continue to climb./>
<Useless>"You don't want to criminalize homelessness; I understand that balance," said Jon Schlegal, owner of the Snooze restaurant near the Denver Rescue Mission./>
<Useless>"But public health and safety are deteriorating. I have to prioritize that. It's like a basic need. Yes, I want to help the homeless. You have to take care of the public first."/>
<Useless>Denver Mayor Michael Hancock is waiting to see what the council brings forward but said he would like to see a tougher ordinance for the downtown area as well as increased support for homeless people to help them access services./>
<Useless>"We should give the police officers and the downtown businesses the tools to better enforce the violations, the blockage or people sleeping or staging on the public right of way," he said. "Right now the officers don't know what they can and cannot enforce."/>
<Useless>Hancock said the problem needs to be addressed regionally./>
<Useless>"We have to have a conversation with our neighbors ... because we know a lot of homeless are coming across the city boundaries," he said./>
<Useless>But last January's point-in-time survey shows Denver is not the mecca for the homeless that some believe./>
<Useless>Among the 11,377 respondents in the metro-wide assessment, 42 percent of homeless people were found in Denver. Of those in the city, about 19 percent came from other metro counties and nearly 14 percent came from out of state./>
<Useless>Councilman Brown said he would like to see a program in which the city helps send homeless people back to their families to care for them./>
<Useless>"We contact their family and see if they will take them back," he said. "Regardless of where they live, we provide them with a one-way bus ticket."/>
<Useless>In 2005, Denver passed laws to curtail panhandling in downtown Denver, including one that prohibits beggars from sitting or lying down on sidewalks from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. No one has ever been cited under that ordinance, according to the city attorney's office./>
<Useless>A report released this month by the Washington, D.C.-based National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty found that cities are increasingly strengthening their policies around sleeping in public, panhandling and loitering./>
<Useless>"We are concerned about criminalizing the act of homelessness," Parvensky said. "They can't legislate against bodily functions. It essentially criminalizing living."/>
<Useless>The solution, he says, is to get people into housing, help them find jobs and get them assistance with their underlying health issues./>
<Useless>Wade Paige, 54, who hangs out with Stotts on the mall, said he stopped driving a truck a few years ago because of the debilitating effects of emphysema. Without income, he lost his Pennsylvania home, moved to Colorado to stay with his brother and eventually ended up on the streets with Stotts./>
<Useless>Almost every morning, he said, he and Stotts wake up to find boxes of food near their heads - meals that would have been tossed out from restaurants the night before./>
<Useless>"The general public is more than generous. They are sympathetic," he said./>
<Useless>"In a way, I understand why people would want to change the law and get us off the street. But they have to figure out a solution."/>

<Useless>or jpmeyer@denverpost.com ----------------------------------------------------------- Surveys of the city's homeless/>
<Useless>In most years, advocates for the homeless conduct a snapshot-in-time look at the homelessness situation in metro Denver on a particular day, usually in late January./>
<Useless>The figures are inexact, but they help chart the course of action for the year./>
<Useless>Here are key findings from recent surveys (because not all homeless are fully identified, subgroup numbers don't always equal total):/>
<Useless>2011/>
<Useless>11,377 estimated homeless people, including 3,345 single people and at least 6,806 people in families, such as single parents and couples with or without children./>
