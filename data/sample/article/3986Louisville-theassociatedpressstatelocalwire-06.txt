<Useless>Louisville: Occupy protesters must remove tents/>
<Useless>Occupy Louisville protesters are being told that they will no longer be allowed to camp overnight in the city and their tents must be taken down./>
<Useless>The issue has come up as protesters negotiate with the city to renew a permit to continue their occupation of Founder's Square Park in downtown Louisville. />
<Useless>The group's current permit lasts through Dec. 31. City officials have told protesters that they have until Jan. 2 to remove their tents./>
<Useless>Many protesters told The Courier-Journal that the order will result in civil disobedience (http://cjky.it/uKLnov)./>
<Useless>Mayor Greg Fischer says the city is concerned with protesters' safety if they continue to camp during winter months. He says they are welcome to continue protesting during daylight hours./>
<Government>He said camping is not permitted in city parks/><Strategy> and that "it's time for that exception to expire."/>
<Strategy>"A permit like that will basically make the occupation no longer effective in its message," protester Brian Smith said. "We're trying to be a constant presence and force awareness of the issues./>
<Strategy>"The tents are a powerful symbol of the movement."/>
<Legal_Action>Attorney Chris Harrell, who is negotiating with the city on behalf of Occupy Louisville,/><Strategy> said tents are necessary now that that winter is here. /><Camp>[said tents are necessary now that that winter is here.]/>
<Strategy>"It would be nearly impossible to stay in the cold without tents," he said./>
When the newspaper asked Fischer what the result would be if protesters don't comply with the order, the mayor said he hopes they will.
<Strategy>"I just hope they continue setting the tone like they have in the past in terms of being peaceful and constructive, and that they'll comply with the permit that they knew was an exception when we issued it," Fischer said./>
<Camp>Louisville resident Pam Newman, who serves on an Occupy Louisville committee, /><Strategy>said protesters will not take down the 20 tents in Founder's Square. /><Camp>[20 tents in Founder's Square]/><Strategy> She said police will have to remove the tents and kick them out./>
<Strategy>"They've got a group of compliant, peaceful protesters, and they think they can take our tents away?" Newman said. "That's a terrible strategy. Everywhere that's happened, our numbers have swelled."/>
<Strategy>Newman said Fischer's arguments don't hold up./>
<Strategy>"If Mayor Fischer would come down here, he'd see the tents aren't on the ground and people have heat," Newman said. "We are safe, and we are sustainable."/>
