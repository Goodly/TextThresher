<Protester>Two months into the global Occupy Wall Street movement, demonstrators have been holding rallies for “national day of action” and some protesters in Hartford were arrested.   />
<2><Protester>A protest was held in front of Aetna's corporate headquarters at 151 Farmington Ave. at 3 p.m./></> and <Protester>then the group marched to the Broad Street on-ramp of Interstate 84 for a “brief occupation of the entrance to the bridge in an act of civil disobedience.”/>
<Protester>Broad Street was closed near the ramp before and during the event, and police advised drivers to avoid the area and seek alternative routes to I-84./>
<Protester>NBC Connecticut crews at the scene witnessed at least eight arrests, but the exact number is not yet available./>
<Protester>The news release on the demonstrations lists Matt O'Connor, of SEIU Connecticut State Council, and Peggy Buchanan, of Connecticut AFL-CIO, as the media contacts./>
<Opinionor>The reason is “to send a loud message to the powers-that-be: we need good jobs, not painful cuts,” according to a post on the /><Opinionor>SEIU Local 2001 Web site/>.
<Opinionor>It goes on to say, "Demonstration is part of a national day of protests at decaying public structures against policies that have enriched the 1% and impoverished the 99% of Americans. People nationwide will gather at bridges and other sites in need of repair and restoration to demand that America be put back to work now. Protestors (sic) will call on Congress to: create good jobs, stop cuts to vital services &
make Wall Street pay."
