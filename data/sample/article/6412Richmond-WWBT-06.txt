Occupy Richmond Moving to Monroe Park  
RICHMOND, VA (WWBT) - Kanawha Plaza has been unoccupied by protesters for nearly a week.
Now <Info>the Occupy Richmond protesters say they're moving to Monroe Park later this week. />
<Police>Police on horseback and city crews with bulldozers kicked out the protesters in the early morning hours last Monday. />
We may be heading for another clash between police and the protesters.
Police say the same rules apply - you're not allowed to stay in city parks after dark.
The protesters say they're just going to keep occupying different parts of the city.
<Camp>Occupy Richmond protesters gathered at Monroe Park Sunday to go through a few items salvaged after they were kicked out of Kanawha Plaza. />
Nick Spangler lost a bunch of items that night.
"Brand new tent, brand new negative ten degree sleeping bag, blankets and a new winter jacket I had just bought too," Spangler said.  "All of that is gone."
<Government>Kanawha Plaza is now reopen after city crews did some cleaning and maintenance /><Police>after the Occupy Richmond protesters were kicked out. />
<Strategy>"This isn't anything about Kanawha Plaza," Spangler said.  "This is Occupy Richmond and we're going to occupy Richmond."/>
<Strategy>The early morning eviction has even helped with recruitment./><Opinionor> Philip Kelly decided to get involved after seeing them kicked out. />
<Opinionor>"I've always agreed with the movement," Kelly said.  "But that really motivated me to get out here."/>
Now he plans to start spending his nights at Monroe Park.
<Strategy>But who's to say the police won't kick the protesters out of Monroe park too?/>
<Strategy>"I'm certain it's going to happen," Spangler said.  "It's just a matter of when. I would like to think they won't do it but I'm not going to be naive about it."/>
<Useless>This wouldn't be the first time a group was arrested for protesting in Monroe Park. />
<Useless>You may remember several members of a local anarchist group were arrested back in March for illegally camping in the park for a week. />
<Strategy>Spangler says they're already mapping out their next location if they're kicked out of Monroe Park. />
<Strategy>"We mean what we say," he said.  "We have some commitment and resolve here. We want to show you that we want to be heard. We want to be seen and taken seriously."/>
<Info>The official 24-7 occupation of Monroe Park won't start until Wednesday evening. />
