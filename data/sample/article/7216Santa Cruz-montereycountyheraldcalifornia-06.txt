Occupy Santa Cruz dismantled
SANTA CRUZ   <2><Camp>The building at 75 River St. is vacant once more/></><Camp> and the "Occudome" outside the courthouse has been torn down./>
Confrontations between law enforcement and Occupy Santa Cruz, along with <2><Protester>what Occupy says is a splinter group that took over a former bank building last week/></>, ended peacefully late Saturday and early Sunday.
<2><Camp>A group of about 30 people who had occupied an empty River Street building/></><2><Protester> since Wednesday/></><3><Protester> left the building Saturday night/></>, Santa Cruz police said. <2><Protester>No arrests were made /></>[<3><Protester>No arrests were made/></>] and police are compiling a report on damages and identifying those who were involved.
<2><Camp>Several members of Occupy Santa Cruz said the River Street group never sought consensus from Occupy Santa Cruz./></>
<Police>Meanwhile, about 6:30 a.m. Sunday near Occupy Santa Cruz's encampment, about 60 county sheriff's deputies removed an "Occudome" tent /><Camp>[an "Occudome" tent] /><Police>and other belongings of Occupy Santa Cruz that had accumulated near the courthouse steps /><Camp>[courthouse steps]/><Police> on Water Street, but made no arrests and wrote no citations./> <Legal_Action>Sheriff's Lt. Craig Wilson said deputies had been meeting with some group members before clearing the area, and that while a small group initially was combative, most had been cooperative./><Strategy> [Sheriff's Lt.

Wilson said deputies left behind medications, signs and other property and are streamlining the reclamation process for those items law enforcement did confiscate. <Camp>He said the group was welcome to protest there, but could not camp or block access to county buildings or walkways./>
<Legal_Action>Back across the river, police had been negotiating with people who took over the building that formerly housed Coast Commercial Bank at Water and River streets and /><2><Police>then ordered them out Saturday afternoon/></>. <2><Camp>Authorities found the building empty when they arrived at 9:30 p.m. Saturday/></>, police spokesman Zach Friend said. Sunday, the building's parking lot was cordoned off with yellow crime tape and a security guard stood watch.
<2><Police>The occupiers, who said they wanted to turn the building into a community center, had said they would leave the building by 3 p.m. Sunday, but police demanded they leave immediately/></>, Friend said.
<2><Camp>A group called 75 River Community Center released a statement Sunday saying the occupiers "chose to exit the building since it became clear that police were targeting a small group of individuals not directly involved with the occupation."  /></><Strategy>["chose to exit the building since it became clear that police were targeting a small group of individuals not directly involved with the occupation."]/>
<2><Camp>The group said in its statement,/></> <Strategy>"The police and some media have focused on Wells Fargo as the 'victim' in this scenario. ... /><Opinionor>The real injustice is people being pillaged out of homes they spent years working legitimately to obtain by an objectively greedy and inherently predatory legal entity."/>
The property was bought in 2008 by Wells Fargo, which has a branch across the street. County records indicate that the building's owner is Associates 1 and Thomson Property Tax Services.
<2><Camp>A woman leaving the building Sunday, who said she was a representative of the property owner, would say only that there was "a lot of debris" inside./></>
Police said the damage tally for the building's occupation would include law enforcement costs. Friend said <2><Camp>charges against those involved could include trespassing, vandalism and conspiracy./></>
<2><Camp>Chief Kevin Vogel said there was enough damage to arrest those inside for felony vandalism. Police say they have been documenting who's been inside the building and have several names, including a well-known anarchist. /></><Strategy>[Police say they have been documenting who's been inside the building and have several names, including a well-known anarchist.]/>
<Strategy>"We'll be looking to prosecute these people to the fullest extent possible," Vogel said Saturday night. "I'm quite pleased it was resolved this way. I'm sorry it had to get to this."/>
<Strategy>Meanwhile, city leaders expressed satisfaction with the resolution of the occupation./>
<Strategy>"I'm very pleased that we were able to resolve this without putting our officers and community at risk," Mayor Ryan Coonerty said. "I appreciate the strategic leadership by our Police Department."/>
The Police Department had been crafting the exit strategy since <3><Police>Wednesday night when they backed off of their first attempt. That night about 30 officers in riot gear surrounded the entrance of the building but were met with close to 200 protesters who were blocking the entrance, which had been barricaded from the inside with office furniture./></>
<3><Police>Police decided to regroup and develop a strategy./></>
