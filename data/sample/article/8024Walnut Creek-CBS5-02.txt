<Useless>“We got a lot of support today—a lot of truck drivers came by and gave us a honk—I think we felt very energized because we had that support,” she said. “Our message is basically the same as (Occupy Wall Street) — corporations have too much power and influence the government too much, and it hurts the rest of us,” she said./>
Ellis Goldberg, also a TriValley MoveOn organizer, said the event kicked off a week full of demonstrations in and around Contra Costa County.
