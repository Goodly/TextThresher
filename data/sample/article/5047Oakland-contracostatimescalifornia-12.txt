OAKLAND -- The results and ramifications of the <Protester>Nov. 2 Occupy Oakland general/>
<Protester>strike /><2><Protester>[Nov. 2 Occupy Oakland general] [strike]/></><Protester>  />are slowly coming into focus less than 48 hours after <Protester>thousands of protesters filled the streets downtown />and <2><Protester>[thousands of protesters ] shut down the Port of Oakland./></>
<3><Protester>A second veteran of the Iraq War was injured and in stable condition at Highland/></>
<3><Protester>Hospital./></>
<3><Protester>Kayvan Sabehgi, 32, was in fair condition Friday evening in the intensive care/></>
<3><Protester>unit./></>
<3><Protester>The Guardian is reporting that he told them he was beaten by police during a/></>
<3><Protester>clash with law enforcement after the strike. But his allegations have not been/></>
<3><Protester>verified by authorities./></>
<4><Protester>Another veteran, Scott Olsen, was also taken to Highland after suffering a/></>
<4><Protester>severe fracture to his skull during an Oct. 25 protest./></>
The spirit of the Occupy movement and general strike, however, continued <5><Protester>Friday/></>
<5><Protester>when a group of moms and their children called the "Colorful Mamas of the 99/></>
<5><Protester>Percent" tried to enter Wells Fargo Bank in downtown./></>
<5><Protester>The group supported both the Occupy Wall Street and Bank Transfer Day movements./></>
<5><Protester>At least three moms closed their accounts before the bank locked its doors in/></>
<5><Protester>response to the protest, which began about noon at the branch on Franklin/></>
<5><Protester>Street./></>
Meanwhile, the city is still tallying the cost for police and city services
utilized during the <Protester>strike, which was fairly peaceful, though windows at/>
<Protester>municipal buildings at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza were broken, Whole Foods was damaged/>
<Protester>and sprayed with graffiti and other downtown banks and businesses were/>
<Protester>vandalized./>
<Government>The tab to replace 18 broken windows in municipal buildings in the plaza is/>
<Government>estimated at $20,000 to $25,000, city officials said./>
<3><Protester>And about two-thirds of the 103 people arrested during melees that followed late/></>
<3><Protester>Wednesday and early Thursday were not from Oakland. People taken into custody/></>
<3><Protester>for failure to disperse and facing other charges came from as far away as Texas,/></>
<3><Protester>Michigan, New York, Utah, New Jersey and Oregon./></>
<3><Protester>Just before midnight Wednesday, a group of people that police are calling/></>
<3><Protester>anarchists started fires, tossed firecrackers into burning fires, broke windows/></>
<3><Protester>and caused other destruction downtown. Most of the 103 people arrested were/></>
<3><Protester>taken in for remaining at "the place of any riot, rout, or unlawful assembly,/></>
<3><Protester>after they have been warned to disperse," authorities said./></>
<3><Protester>Others were arrested and accused of resisting arrest, assault with a deadly/></>
<3><Protester>weapon, vandalism, battery on a police officer and a parole violation./></>
<3><Protester>Of the 103 arrested, 32 are from Oakland, 42 are from other Bay Area cities, 15/></>
<3><Protester>are from other parts of California and nine are from out of state. Two of those/></>
<3><Protester>arrested were 17-year-old juveniles who were cited and released. One is from/></>
<3><Protester>Washington, the other from San Mateo County. Hometowns for three of those/></>
<3><Protester>arrested were not released. Of those arrested, 92 were cited and 11 were kept in/></>
<3><Protester>custody./></>
BART reported unusually heavy ridership Wednesday because so many people took
trains to the rallies. Some 391,000 rode BART, compared with 370,000 on a
typical weekday, said district spokesman Jim Allison.<Protester> About 6,100 more than/>
<Protester>usual passengers exited the Oakland 12th Street station, he said/>
<5><Protester>The group of 40 moms and children marched from Snow Park by Lake Merritt, where/></>
<5><Protester>Occupy Oakland protesters still maintain about a dozen tents./></>
<Camp>The 300 or so people living in the downtown camp arose Friday morning to chilly/>
<Camp>temperatures />but promised to stick it out, rain or shine. They have been
collecting blankets and extra tarps to keep out the rain and cold. People
wandered around the camp Friday with their hoods up, drinking hot coffee and
trying to stay warm.
"I can survive any weather," said Kenaja Mwari, 23, of Oakland. Gesturing toward
City Hall, he added "If we aren't going to let the people stop us, why would we
let some weather stop us?"
