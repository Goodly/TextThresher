SAN FRANCISCO (CNN) --  <Police>Police in riot gear moved into the Occupy Oakland/>
<Police>encampment Monday, tearing down tents and arresting some protesters, /><Useless>the latest/>
<Useless>effort by city officials across the country to gain control over a movement that/>
<Useless>some leaders say has become a public safety and health threat./>
<Police>Oakland, California, police, aided by dozens of officers from nearby/>
<Police>jurisdictions, arrested 32 people in the effort to clear Frank Ogawa Plaza near/>
<Police>City Hall before dawn, /><2><Police>Interim Chief Howard Jordan said. /></><Police>There were no reports/>
<Police>of injuries or complaints of abuse, /><2><Police>he said./></>
<Strategy>The camp had become an unbearable drain on city resources /><Government>[drain on city resources]/><Strategy>, an economic threat to/>
<Strategy>nearby businesses and a danger to public safety,/> <Government>Mayor Jean Quan said./>
<Strategy>"The encampment became a place where we had repeated violence and this week a/>
<Strategy>murder. We had to bring the camp to an end before more people were hurt,"/> she
said.
<Useless>The developments in Oakland come amid rising concern from city officials around/>
<Useless>the country that the protests drain resources and threaten public health. What/>
<Useless>started as the Occupy Wall Street movement in New York in September has spread/>
<Useless>across cities worldwide as a call to action against unequal distribution of/>
<Useless>wealth and other issues./>
<Useless>In Oregon, Portland police made more than 50 arrests Sunday as they cleared two/>
<Useless>parks -- Chapman and Lownsdale Square -- of protesters./>
<Useless>Police called in reinforcements from surrounding jurisdictions, and more than/>
<Useless>300 officers took part in the sweep -- which went off without incident,/>
<Useless>authorities said./>
<Useless>"We acted proactively," Portland Mayor Sam Adams told reporters on Monday. "We/>
<Useless>were not going to wait until somebody died in a camp."/>
<Useless>He thanked police and other city employees for their work and encouraged/>
<Useless>protesters to find a new outlet./>
<Useless>"I hope that this Occupy Wall Street movement will focus and pivot and realize/>
<Useless>its potential as a national and international movement.," he said./>
<Useless>In Philadelphia, Mayor Michael Nutter said Sunday that what started as a/>
<Useless>peaceful protest 39 days ago has given way to increasing public safety and/>
<Useless>public health concerns./>
<Useless>"Occupy Philly has changed," Nutter said. "We're seeing serious health and/>
<Useless>safety issues playing out on an almost daily basis. ... The people of Occupy/>
<Useless>Philly have also changed and their intentions have changed. And all of this is/>
<Useless>not good for Philadelphia."/>
<Useless>A woman reported she was sexually assaulted Saturday night in a tent at the/>
<Useless>encampment, Nutter said. CNN affiliate WPVI reported a suspect was arrested in/>
<Useless>the alleged assault./>
<Useless>The mayor also cited the threat of fire near historic City Hall and concerns/>
<Useless>about litter, public urination, defecation and graffiti./>
<Useless>Numerous reports of thefts and assaults in the encampment have been made, and 15/>
<Useless>emergency medical runs were made between October 6 and November 11, he said./>
<Useless>Protesters are also blocking a planned $50 million renovation at Dilworth Plaza,/>
<Useless>where they are camping, threatening jobs of workers on the project, Nutter said./>
<Useless>The protesters are "purposely standing in the way of nearly 1,000 jobs for/>
<Useless>Philadelphians at a time of high unemployment," Nutter said. "They are blocking/>
<Useless>Philadelphians from taking care of their families."/>
<Useless>"We have things we need to do," Nutter said. "I understand that they have things/>
<Useless>on their mind as Americans and wish to express their free speech. I understand/>
<Useless>that, I get that, I've defended that. The things we're talking about, the/>
<Useless>activities that are going on, are not about free speech. They're public health/>
<Useless>and public safety concerns that have nothing to do with Wall Street and/>
<Useless>corporations."/>
<Useless>In Denver, police arrested three protesters on Sunday, a day after taking 17/>
<Useless>people into custody in a dispute over clearing furniture and tents that city/>
<Useless>officials said were blocking a right of way./>
<Useless>Police in Tulsa, Oklahoma, arrested six people and issued four citations for/>
<Useless>remaining in a park past curfew Sunday night, Officer Jason Willingham said./>
<Useless>In Nashville, authorities dismissed charges against 55 Occupy protesters who had/>
<Useless>been given trespassing citations. The protesters had been demonstrating at the/>
<Useless>state Capitol grounds./>
<Useless>The prosecutor in the case asked that the charges be dismissed, and the judge/>
<Useless>agreed, Tennessee General Sessions Court administrator Warner Hassell said./>
<Government>The Oakland operation will likely cost the city between $300,000 and $500,000,/>
<Government>City Administrator Deanna Santana said./>
<Info>City officials planned to clean up the plaza and reopen it to protests by Monday/>
<Info>evening./>
<Government>Jordan said city officials will enforce a ban on camping in the park with an/>
<3><Police>around-the-clock police presence./></><Government> But he said peaceful demonstrators would be/>
<Government>allowed to remain at the site around the clock, if they wished, so long as they/>
<Government>don't bring tents, sleeping bags or other "lodging equipment."/>
<Strategy>"If you're not breaking the laws, we're not concerned about your presence,"/> he
said.
<Camp>The plaza was one of two Occupy camps in the city./> <2><Camp>The other, at Snow Park,/></>
<2><Camp>remained standing. /></><4><Police>Jordan said police would not move against that camp on/></>
<4><Police>Monday, /></>but added it could be dismantled later.
<Strategy>Protesters are meanwhile looking for a private space from which to protest,/> city
officials said.
The decision to clear the plaza prompted a longtime friend of Quan who described
himself as her legal adviser to resign.
"No longer Mayor Quan's legal advisor. Resigned at 2 am. Support Occupy Oakland,
not the 1% and its government facilitators," attorney Dan Siegel said in the
post, which Siegel confirmed to CNN was accurate.
City spokeswoman Susan Piper described Siegel as a "volunteer adviser."
