<Strategy>The Oakland, Calif. police union on Tuesday slammed the mayor for her stance on/>
<Strategy>the city's Occupy Wall Street protests,/> further testing the embattled leader's
administration a day before <Info>demonstrators planned a general strike./>
<Police>The Oakland Police Officer's Association sent a letter to Mayor Jean Quan/>
<Strategy>questioning why the city plans to beef up its police presence at strike-related/>
<Strategy>events while giving other city workers leeway to participate./>
<Strategy>"Is it the City's intention to have City employees on both sides of a skirmish/>
<Strategy>line?"/><2><Police> the letter said./></>
City offices are to remain open Wednesday. <Info>Quan's office urged businesses not to/>
<Info>close. Protesters are planning several large gatherings in downtown Oakland/>
<Info>throughout the day, culminating with a march to the Port of Oakland in early/>
<Info>evening./>
<Strategy>Protesters say they are heading to the port one of the country's largest to/>
<Strategy>block "the flow of capital."/>
<Government>In a memo Friday, City Administrator Deanna Santana said workers can use/>
<Government>vacation or other paid time off to participate in the strike./><Strategy> [In a memo Friday, City Administrator Deanna Santana said workers can use/>

<Government>the police union said./>
Quan's office did not immediately respond to the letter.
The mayor, in office for less than a year, has struggled to formulate a coherent
response to <3><Protester>the Occupy encampment that has sat for three weeks on the plaza /></>in
front of Oakland City Hall. It was interrupted by the raid.
A self-described civil rights activist with roots in the San Francisco Bay
Area's progressive movements stretching back to UC Berkeley's protest scene in
the 1960s,<Strategy> Quan has said she and the city support the demonstrators./>
But <Government>after a little more than a week into the protest, the city asked/>
<Government>demonstrators to break up the encampment/>,<Strategy> claiming sanitation and safety/>
<Strategy>problems had reached unacceptable levels. /><Government>Protesters ignored an official/>
<Government>eviction notice/>. Police then broke up the camp.
Since then, Quan has acquiesced to the camp's return, although <Legal_Action>the city is still/>
<Legal_Action>officially requesting that protesters leave between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m./>
<Legal_Action>Protesters heckled and booed Quan when she tried to make a statement to the/>
<Legal_Action>group last week, sending her retreating into City Hall./>
<2><Police>Police presence around the protesters has diminished since the initial crackdown/></>
<2><Police>last week, which included the use of tear gas and beanbag rounds/></> and lead
prominent liberals to call for her resignation.
As indicated by Tuesday's letter, her support among police officers has
diminished even more than it had following the resignation of popular former
Chief Anthony Batts in early October.
<Opinionor>"It was sort of remarkable that she was able to alienate both sides," said/>
<Opinionor>University of San Francisco political scientist Corey Cook of Quan's/>
<Opinionor>relationship with protesters and police. "She has no friends at this point."/>
