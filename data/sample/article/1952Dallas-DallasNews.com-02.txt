<Protester>After a half-mile walk from their camp near City Hall, about 30 demonstrators gathered outside the Jack Evans Police Headquarters building on Lamar Street, where they hung out, displayed posters and posed near officers for photographs./>
<Strategy>Their handwritten messages called for police to join the protest (“Stop Silencing the Police,” “Officers R People as Well,” “Give Officers Their Voice”) and for protecting the police pension (“Police Pension Solidarity”)./> <Opinionor>Other signs reminded that police officers are not among the mega-rich being targeted by the Occupy movement worldwide./>
<Strategy>A central goal was to express appreciation for officers who have shown relative restraint with Occupy Dallas, now in its third week on the streets. />[<Protester>Occupy Dallas, now in its third week on the streets.]/>

A demonstrator wearing a jokerish mask (“I work for a large corporation”) and calling himself Webfish agreed.
<Strategy>“They’ve escorted us (on protest marches). And most of them have been very respectful,” he said. “If you look at what happened in Oakland, these officers have been phenomenal.” /><ToBe>[“They’ve escorted us (on protest marches).]/>
<Useless>Oakland police, wearing riot gear and wielding tear gas, earlier this week arrested more than 100 protesters. At least 53 protesters were rounded up in Atlanta./>
Who knows what the future will bring for protesters and authorities. But for now Dallas has been among the cities where public dissent against corporate greed and the nation’s widening wealth divide has been relatively peaceful.

<Strategy>Deputy Police Chief Mike Genovesi, the department’s central division commander, said officers want to maintain their dialogue with the group./>
<Strategy>“We’re focusing on public safety and keeping the peace,” he said. As for the future: “We want to avoid violence as best we can,” he said. “And a lot of that will depend on them.”/>

Glynn Wilcox, an adviser to the group, said Thursday that the protesters are becoming more organized and generally collaborating well without official leaders.
<Strategy>The group’s mostly peaceful coexistence with authorities />“may be losing some cred for us” among the more radical people in the global movement, he said.
But the more important goal is sustaining the camp and pressing on with the messages, said Wilcox, an account manager for a corporation he did not want to identify.
“The whole point of the Occupy movement is to have a long-term presence,” he said.
There has been a snag for the protesters. <Camp>The city won’t allow portable toilets at the campsite. And Occupy Dallas has been unable to secure space nearby for such convenience./>
“Our biggest problem is where to go to the bathroom,” Wilcox said. “How mundane is that?”
