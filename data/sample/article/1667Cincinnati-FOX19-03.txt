'Occupy Cincinnati' holding event Saturday
CINCINNATI, OH (FOX19) -                         
<Info>Occupy Cincinnati is holding an event on Saturday./>
The group has bloomed from the Occupy movement that began on Wall Street in New York City, where protestors have been gathering since Sept. 17. By Thursday afternoon, Occupy Together "meetups" could be found in 575 cities that stretched across the world to places as diverse as Athens, Greece, and Wellington, New Zealand.
A common slogan of the group is, "We are the 99 percent," referring to the group's belief that the greed and corruption of the wealthiest American corporations and citizens, symbolized by Wall Street, can no longer be tolerated.
<Info>The Occupy Cincinnati event begins at 11 a.m. in Lytle Park on Saturday, Oct. 8. The group will then march to Fountain Square, where a rally will be held from 3 p.m. to 1 a.m./>
