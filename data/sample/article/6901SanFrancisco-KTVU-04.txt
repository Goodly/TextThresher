SF police canceled planned raid of 'Occupy' encampment


SAN FRANCISCO — <Info>The two raids police had planned to conduct at Justin Herman Plaza, one late Wednesday night or early Thursday morning, and a second one Thursday afternoon, were canceled at the last minute./>
<Government>San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee said Thursday the encampment at Justin Herman Plaza needed to be cleaned up./>
<Legal_Action>“We're kind of trying to strike an agreement about how that can get done without being threatening to either side, so that's all I can say at this time,” />Lee told KTVU.
The Mayor told KTVU he will announce his plans for Justin Herman plaza by Saturday afternoon.
<Legal_Action>“There's been an agreement until he responds to us in 48 hours, it would be inappropriate to take police action,” />said demonstrator Nicole Ghanbarzadeh.
<Police>Early Thursday morning, police officers gathered on Treasure Island/> and <2><Police>last night they were staged in Portrero Hill./></>
San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr said Thursday these were just training exercises.
<Strategy>Supervisor John Avalos, who's running for mayor, told KTVU he suspects what happened in Oakland gave the mayor and police chief second thoughts about carrying out a raid at Justin Herman Plaza./>
“Clearly the use of force did not work in Oakland and they don't want to have egg on their face here in SF,” Avalos said.
Police sources said some officers were placed on overtime to conduct the raids before they were cancelled.
<Strategy>Police told KTVU both the mayor and the police chief are experienced in dealing with protestors and both likely came to the agreement that the timing was not right./>
Lisa Matthews, a single mother said she's cautiously optimistic now that there has been a dialogue with the mayor.
“I'm glad they're finally wanting to talk to us instead of just treating us like we don't exist and that we're just a problem,” Matthews said.
Police said there is also some concern that with Halloween coming on Monday, troublemakers could take advantage of the protest and cause problems.
