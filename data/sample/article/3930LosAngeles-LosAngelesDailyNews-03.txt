LOS ANGELES -- The city Department of General Services barricaded a fountain and a memorial sculpture in front of City Hall to protect them from damage by <Protester>people camped on the lawn for Occupy L.A., which turns one month old today. />
<Useless>The Frank Putnam Flint Fountain was built in 1933 in honor of the senator's efforts to bring water to Los Angeles. A firefighters' memorial on the southwest corner of the City Hall lawn was built in 1944 to honor fire personnel killed in the line of duty./>
The structures had sustained some non-permanent graffiti, mayoral spokesman Peter Sanders said. At least one protester had been spotted periodically sitting on top of the fountain, and protesters had also hung a movie screen from the fountain to project videos.
Construction of a nearly 20-foot-high wooden structure began about 4 this morning, demonstrators said, and took about six hours to complete.
City officials told the campers they were free to use the structure as a canvas for art work, said Keaton Yale, who joined Occupy L.A. a few days ago, and a number of people immediately started spray-painting it with graffiti-style writings and graphics.
Someone sprayed a large, colorful "Power to the People" on the west side of the structure surrounding the fountain.
Yale described the markings as less than attractive.
"It's all art, but it's not necessarily pleasing art," Yale said, adding that he hoped attendees at the movement's general assembly meeting tonight would take up the issue of selecting an artist to paint something "beautiful" on the structure. He said he was concerned the graffiti would upset people driving around City Hall and discredit the Occupy movement.
"There's a lot of good here, but there's some people here that don't know why they're here," Yale said. "If stuff gets too crazy, I'm probably going to find a better organized thing."
<Protester>Occupy L.A. began Oct. 1 when protesters set up about 40 tents  on the north side of City Hall/><Camp> [set up about 40 tents  on the north side of City Hall ] />in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street. <Useless>The demonstrations, which have spread nationwide, have sought to highlight what protesters call a widening gap between rich and poor./>
Occupy L.A. has since grown about tenfold.<Camp> Los Angeles police this morning counted about 475 tents on the 1.7-acre city park surrounding City Hall./>
<Useless>The much-smaller Occupy San Fernando Valley movement, which began on Saturday, continues in the courtyard of Van Nuys Civic Center. But unlike the downtown version, the Valley protesters are forbidden to camp overnight at the site./>
<Useless> About 8-10 people show up daily at the Van Nuys Civic Center, said LAPD Captain Tia Morris. The group leaves by 7 p.m. "Then they go to Van Nuys Boulevard and wave their signs and march," said Morris./>
