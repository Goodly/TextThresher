CINCINNATI -<Government> No longer is anyone allowed to lie down on a Cincinnati park bench, park ledge, and in some cases, the ground in any of the city's roughly 5,000 acres of park land, according to a new rule approved by the Cincinnati Park Board./>
<Government>The park board - for the second time in two months - also altered a rule attorneys for Occupy Cincinnati have been questioning in court concerning special use permits. /><Legal_Action>[ a rule attorneys for Occupy Cincinnati have been questioning in court concerning special use permits.]/>
<Government>Park officials argue these changes aren't a reaction to Occupy Cincinnati, but instead necessary clarification points, even as hundreds of criminal citations - issued for breaking this rule - are pending in Hamilton County Municipal Court./><Legal_Action> [ hundreds of criminal citations - issued for breaking this rule - are pending in Hamilton County Municipal Court.]/>
<Opinionor>"Our policies have not changed, but the rules did not clearly define the policies that we were following,"/><Government> City Parks' spokeswoman and Business Services Manager Deborah Allison said./> <Strategy>"We wanted to clarify them because the rules have to apply equally to everyone."/>

<Government>Then, at its Dec. 15 meeting, the board - with both president and vice president absent - took a red pen to its rules again and amended nine of 40 park rules./>
A request to speak with one of the board members was not fulfilled Monday and attempts by The Enquirer to reach the president and vice president at home were unsuccessful.
<Government>Allison said she was speaking for the board,/> but <Strategy>could not answer specific questions as to why some changes were made, like new Rule 37, which bars "lying upon park property." She said the board knew other cities have enacted such a rule./>

<Strategy>It's no coincidence, he says, that the rules were changed or added to after City Parks />Director Willie Carden's testimony Dec. 6 in the first Occupy Cincinnati court hearing, which has been continued until Jan. 31. "That day I asked (Carden), 'Is there anything in this rule that prohibits camping?' In both cases he said he didn't know," Linneman said.
<Government>Changes to Rule 29 include an added clause requiring a permit when "erecting structures" in a park. The word "tent," however, doesn't exist in any park rule. Some of the changes made have little chance of affecting Occupy Cincinnati, including traffic speeds, hunting and carrying a firearm in the parks, Allison pointed out. />
