<Opinionor>Occupy Wall Street protesters are flocking to nearby health clinics for STD and HIV testing after getting their freak on in ’60s-style hookups with crusty strangers, sources told The Post yesterday./>
<Opinionor>“Last week was free love,” said a medical professional at a clinic located a short walk from Zuccotti Park, referring to the number of people who organizers have referred for sexually transmitted disease testing./>
<Opinionor>A volunteer at the park admitted concern among protesters about STDs./>
<Opinionor>“We give directions to clinics if people ask for information regarding STDs,” said the volunteer, who identified himself only as “Captain” and added that pregnancy tests are also a hot item./>
<Opinionor>“Like anything else, it happens. People ask, and we do the best we can for them.”/>
<Opinionor>Volunteers at the medical tent hand out cash, usually $15 or $20, so the randy radicals can visit clinics that cater to a low-income clientele, the source said./>
<Opinionor>Experts said it’s the right thing to do./>
<Opinionor>“My advice for the protesters would be to practice safer sex. It’s a lot cheaper to buy a condom than get treated for an STD,” said Dr. Lisa Oldson, medical director of Chicago-based Analyte Health, which provides testing services for labs nationwide, including STD Test Express New York./>

“Nobody is claiming that this is the crime of the century, but what he did ... was assault,” said Ron Kuby, the lawyer for Felix Rivera-Pitre, who was hit by Deputy Inspector John Cardona in an incident caught on video.
