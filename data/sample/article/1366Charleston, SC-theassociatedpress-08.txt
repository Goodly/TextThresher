<Useless>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside St. Paul's Cathedral over the weekend. Many have since hunkered down outside the cathedral, pitching tents and setting up a makeshift kitchen, toilets and an information center. Until now, church staff members have allowed the protesters to remain. But in a statement released late Wednesday, St. Paul's said that the "increased scale and nature" of the camp could make it more difficult for the cathedral to stay open for worshippers and tourists./>
<Useless>NEW YORK/>
<Useless>A plainclothes police officer who's becoming known as the "hipster cop" for his fashion sense says he thinks his rising profile helps "break down a lot of walls." Detective Rick Lee, 45, has been the subject of much Internet chatter for showing up at Zuccotti Park for his work as a community affairs officer wearing narrow ties, cardigan sweaters and thick-framed glasses./>
<Useless>Rainy weather put a damper on the protests Wednesday, with demonstrators huddled under tarps. A couple of die-hards stood in the downpour holding up American flags and wearing gas masks./>
