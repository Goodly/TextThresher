LONG BEACH - As police in Oakland cleared a camp of Occupy protesters <Camp>Tuesday, participants in Long Beach's offshoot of the anti-Wall Street movement operated in a detente with law enforcement at Lincoln Park./>
Speaking against what they called the "tyranny" of large banks and corporations, <Camp>Occupy Long Beach has settled into a pattern of small, lounging protests by day, gathering after business hours in larger numbers and, for the die-hard adherents to the group, striking their tents and moving to the sidewalk after 10 p.m./>
<Legal_Action>The ongoing schedule agreement was reached through consultation between police and leaders of the now 11-day-old occupation of the park next to City Hall at 333 W. Ocean Blvd./><Protester> [The ongoing schedule agreement was reached through consultation between police and leaders of the now 11-day-old occupation of the park next to City Hall at 333 W.

<Police>Long Beach Deputy Police Chief Robert Luna said/><Government> the policy itself was created after study of the city's ordinance that bars camping in parks and public spaces./>
<Strategy>He defined the ensuing rules as firm but respectful in regard to what protesters can and cannot do./>
<Strategy>"Our goal is to allow them to exercise their First Amendment rights without being in violation of the city ordinance,"/> Luna said.
Though protesters can slumber at night, there's no real sleep for the weary at Lincoln Park in the eyes of the law.
<Government>"They can rest for a while, but they have to wake up and walk around periodically,"/> Luna said.
<Strategy>Protesters this week credited police for working with them, but complained about the floodlights that have been used at night to illuminate the park./>
<Opinionor>Among their demands of government was a call for restoring regulations governing corporations that have been cut over the last few decades./>
<Opinionor>"A corporation is unaccountable to people," said Jonathan Allen, 26, of Seal Beach./>
<Opinionor>Small businesses and banks can't compete against conglomerates such as Wal-Mart and Bank of America in the present era of deregulation, he argued./>
<Opinionor>"The analogy is a pro-football player geared up, ready to tackle an elementary school football player," Allen said./>
A 27-year-old woman who identified herself as Sunrise pointed to vacant office space around Lincoln Park and said she shows up out of a desire to rebuild the community.
<Opinionor>"I believe you can't change the world unless you change the community you live in first," she said./>
<Camp>Besides attracting attention to its cause, Occupy Long Beach, like other chapters nationwide, has also attracted part of downtown's homeless population./>
<Camp>"They're flocking to us for the free food," said Allen./>
<Camp>Some homeless participate in the protests or hold signs, while others squabble with protesters for what they view as their "territory," according to Allen./>
<Camp>"They need to realize they're part of the 99 percent," Allen said, adding that organizers are considering a move to another city park./>
<Camp>Criminal incidents at Lincoln Park have been sporadic, officials said./>
<ToBe>The few protesters who have been arrested for camping in the park after 10 p.m. were given verbal warnings and blatantly violated the regulations agreed upon by officers and Occupy Long Beach representatives, police said./>
<Camp>Sunday night, after police experimented with turning off the floodlights at night, two protesters were arrested for domestic violence, and a homeless couple fought over a cellphone and were arrested for allegedly making terrorist threats,/> <Police>Luna said./>
<Strategy>Luna was grateful for the relative peace in Long Beach, considering other cities have experienced less cooperative, more civilly disobedient protesters./>
<Strategy>"We've had some problems with a few individuals getting into officers' faces and trying to force confrontations, but the vast majority have been respectful and so have the officers," />Luna said.
