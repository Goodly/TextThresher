LOS ANGELES (KABC) --<Info> Occupy protesters say they are going to try to stop people from spending money at big retailers. It's part of the so-called "Spend Nothing Day."/> 
Some protesters don't want people to shop at all, while others just want to divert shoppers to local
<Useless>In Santa Ana, a group of them gathered in the Wal-Mart on Harbor Boulevard, telling employees not to go to work on Friday. />
<Useless>In Seattle, protesters are carpooling to Wal-Mart stores to protest with other Occupy groups from around Washington state. />
<Useless>Others plan to hit the mall. The 75-person encampment in Boise, Idaho, will send "consumer zombies" to wander around in silent protest of what they view as unnecessary spending. In Chicago, protesters will serenade shoppers with revamped Christmas carols about buying local. />
<Useless>The idea comes from Adbusters magazine, which helped launch the Occupy movement. This will be the 20th year the magazine encouraged people to refrain from spending after Thanksgiving. />
