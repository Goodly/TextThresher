<Protester>An Oakland man says a police officer shot him with a rubber bullet or beanbag/>
<Protester>while he was videotaping last week's standoff between law enforcement and a/>
<Protester>small group that took over a building and lit fires after a day of peaceful/>
<Protester>anti-Wall Street protests./>
<Protester>Experts in police use of force who reviewed the footage Scott Campbell captured/>
<Protester>say it appears the volley was unprovoked and inappropriate, the Oakland Tribune/>
<Protester>reported Tuesday/> (http://bit.ly/rQfuLG).
In the video posted on YouTube (http://bit.ly/sFSYJP),<Protester> Campbell, 30, is heard/>
<Protester>calling, "Is this OK?" to a line of riot gear-clad officers. He told the/>
<Protester>newspaper that he was asking if his distance from them was adequate because an/>
<Protester>officer had asked him to step back. A firearm held by an officer then is seen/>
<Protester>going off, followed by Campbell's yelps of pain./>
<2><Protester>The Oakland Police Department, which also has been criticized for wounding an/></>
<2><Protester>Iraq War veteran during an Oct. 25 skirmish,/></> did not respond to a request for
comment.
University of South Carolina criminal justice professor Geoffrey Alpert said
that unless something occurred off-camera to provoke the officer, the shooting
was "one of the most outrageous uses of a firearm" he'd ever seen.
"Unless there's a threat that you can't see in the video, that just looks like
absolute punishment, which is the worst type of excessive force," Alpert said.
<Protester>Campbell, who identifies himself as an anarchist, said he took video of the/>
<Protester>confrontation that occurred early Nov. 3 because he wanted to document any/>
<Protester>instances of excessive force, but did not imagine that he would be a target./>
<Protester>Authorities have said they moved to arrest more than 100 people and used tear/>
<Protester>gas and beanbags after a small group of self-proclaimed anarchists entered a/>
<Protester>vacant building with bottles and flares and then lit fires in the street when/>
<Protester>officers tried to clear the building./>
