Chesapeake man helps organize 'occupy norfolk'
While thousands across the country have been marching in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street, a Chesapeake native spearheaded the Occupy Norfolk protest.
James McPherson, a 24-year-old Old Dominion University and Oscar Smith High alumnus, played a key role organizing the local movement, which attracted <Protester>about 30 people Thursday, the national day of protest. />
<Useless>The night before Thursday's national march, he and a few others from the group took the Chinatown bus to New York to experience Occupy Wall Street for themselves./>
<Useless>"We were only there for maybe 10 hours," McPherson said. "We just kind of wanted to lay eyes on it before we started it here./>
<Useless>"There were thousands of people - students, unions, all different people - who would really like to see the national dialogue reset."/>
<Useless>The group tried to rally in with the Occupy Wall Street demonstrators, who have protested against what they say is corporate greed that has expanded the gap between the richest 1 percent of Americans and the rest./>
<Useless>Holding signs reading "I am the 99%," the small group sat around the parking lot at Harbor Park on Thursday waiting for the proper permits to move to a more visible location downtown./>
McPherson, who has a part-time job, said he anticipated the crowd to grow over the weekend and eventually <Info>wants to get a permit for camping out downtown/>.<Useless> A goal is to make Occupy Norfolk a permanent movement, similar to New York's, where protester numbers have been growing for the past three weeks./>
"Why should Norfolk miss out on a movement that could potentially affect the national dialogue on a political issue?" he said. "<Strategy>This is my first attempt at a political movement. We're dealing with a movement of people who are not typically political activists. We need to raise awareness locally and get people politically conscious."/>
<Useless>COMING UP IN CITY HALL/>
<Useless>After months, maybe years, of pushing for the kind of strategic planning session that would last more than a few hours on a Tuesday night, Councilman C.E. "Cliff" Hayes' efforts are paying off./>
<Useless>City Council is scheduled to hold a planning session Wednesday, Oct. 19./>
<Useless>Other South Hampton Roads cities hold annual retreats, some a couple days long, to make sure the City Council is well informed by the different departments and on upcoming issues./>
<Useless>"CHESAPEAKE SPEAKS UP"/>
<Useless>Near the end of the month, the City Council will host a "citizen input session" to give residents the chance to comment on the 2011-12 budget, which went into effect July 1. The meeting will be Oct. 27 beginning at 6 p.m. at the Chesapeake Conference Center./>
