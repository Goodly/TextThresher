While protesters camping out in San Francisco and Oakland got a visit from Michael Moore, another group of activists took their message to San Francisco’s Ocean Beach this weekend.
On Saturday, about 1,000 people used their bodies to spell out “Tax the 1%.”
“I work hard every day,” said event co-organizer and Bay Area cab driver, Brad Newsham. “It isn’t right that I pay higher taxes than billionaires like Warren Buffet. And actually, Mr. Buffet agrees with me on this.”
The event organizers timed their protest to be “almost exactly a year before Election Day 2012,” according to their website, Human Banner SF.
“We’re putting Obama and all the Presidential candidates on notice,” said event co-organizer and Other 98% founder, Andrew Boyd. “The 99% of us have been hammered by this economy. It’s time for the 1% to pay their fair share.”
The protesters were graced with some beautiful weather this weekend and got some breathtaking pictures to go with it. Newsham hired a helicopter and photographer John Montgomery donated his services.
