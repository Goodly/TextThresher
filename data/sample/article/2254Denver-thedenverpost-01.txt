<ToBe>The protesters gathered across from the state Capitol early Friday/> had a frequent refrain: <Opinionor>"Freedom doesn't have a curfew,"/> they chanted.
But when the right of the people to assemble and protest comes crashing into the authority of a government to set the rules for public property - as it did in <Police>Lincoln Park /><Camp>[Lincoln Park] /><Police>late Thursday and early Friday, when police moved to evict the protesters/> - the law leaves little to doubt.
<Opinionor>"Obviously protesters have the right to use public forums like parks, but it's not an unlimited right," said University of Denver law professor Alan Chen. "The Supreme Court has held quite clearly that government is able to regulate speech in what are called time, place and manner regulations."/>
That means,<Government> on state property, the state government can effectively create regular business hours. If the park is "closed," the protesters have a much harder task arguing that it is illegal to remove them./>
The nearly 30-year-old case that established the law is strikingly similar to the Occupy Denver protest. In Clark vs. Community for Creative Non-Violence, the Supreme Court decided that a rule that prohibited camping in a park near the White House - and prevented protesters from sleeping in the park overnight - was reasonable because the government had an interest in keeping the park from getting trashed.
The key, Chen said, is the regulation must be consistent and apply to everyone, not just certain groups of protesters. That is where state and Denver officials might find themselves in a spot of legal bother, Chen said.
Because<Government> the state closed the park indefinitely after removing the protesters/>, the activists might have an opening to argue that their rights were violated because the government shut down their forum altogether.
<Legal_Action>The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado also raised that question, calling on Gov. John Hickenlooper to reopen the park to protesters by 5 a.m. Sunday. /><Camp>[The American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado also raised that question, calling on Gov.
