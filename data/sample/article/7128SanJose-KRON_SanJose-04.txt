<Useless>No Signs Yet of Occupy Oakland Crackdown/>
<Useless>OAKLAND (KRON) -- Oakland city administrators say they have not reached an official decision about when they will order police to remove the Occupy Oakland tent city in front of city hall despite an earlier order evicting the protesters./>
<Useless>KRON 4's Haaziq Madyun says by mid-afternoon Friday "the sun was shining brightly on Occupy Oakland" with no significant police presence outside the emcampment.  Demonstators opposed to bank bailouts and other issues have established what they call a commune on the plaza in front of city hall and at a nearby park./>
<Useless>Thursday city officials delivered a letter to the protesters telling them they would not be allowed to camp out overnight but could be in the plaza from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. to make their point of view known./>
<Useless>Demonstrators say they're patrolling the area to prevent police from entering.  The letter lists a variety of problems prompting the closure including health and safety hazards, physical damage, and disruption of the plaza for public use./>
<Useless>While the letter said no tents or overnight camping is allowed, it's unclear when or if those belongings will be removed./>
In San Jose, <Police>police did move in Friday morning to clear protesters from in front of city hall./><Camp> [/><Camp>city hall./>]<Police> Five people were arrested for illegal camping, two for unauthorized use of the plaza after 11pm, and one for felony vandalism in the alleged scratching a police vehicle./><Strategy> [/><Strategy>vandalism in the alleged scratching a police vehicle./>]
Despite the crackdowns, the protests show few signs of abating.  A new AP poll finds about a third of Americans say they support the goals of the Occupy protesters around the country.
