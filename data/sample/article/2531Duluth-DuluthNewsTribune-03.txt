The “Occupy” movement has hit the Northland.


About 70 people gathered in Leif Erickson Park in Duluth on Monday night to work on a plan emulating the Occupy Wall Street and Occupy Minnesota rallies in a demand for economic fairness in the country and a protest of “corporate greed.”
<Useless>The rally in New York began Sept. 17 and has slowly captured the attention of a growing number of activists across the country. Last weekend, people gathered in Minneapolis for a Minnesota version. />Now, some of the people from that rally are organizing in Duluth and Superior.
After a declaration opening the “first general assembly” for “Occupy Duluth,” University of Minnesota Duluth student Tyler Nord told the audience about what he learned in Minneapolis over the weekend, going down<Camp> a checklist of work for committees: Food supplies, medical assistance, media contacts, and, in a Duluth twist, “winter clothing.”/>
“The protest of the economy must have an economy of protest,” Nord said.
<Camp>The group went back and forth on when and where to occupy space in Duluth. It was decided that the Minnesota Power Plaza would be a good place to start />because <Info>an “Occupy Solidarity” rally is scheduled there [Minnesota Power Plaza] for 4-6 p.m. Wednesday/>.
<Strategy>Longtime Duluth activist Joel Kilgour from Loaves and Fishes said he had spoken to Duluth Police Chief Gordon Ramsay about/>
<Strategy>possible places an “Occupy” group could gather. Kilgour said the police-protester relationship has been “strong. One of the best I know of.”/>
“You’re not going to see any pepper spraying here,” Kilgour said.
<Strategy>Jim Hansen, the public information officer for the Duluth Police Department, said a tradition of allowing peaceful protest in Duluth would continue. />“It’s one of the great parts about living here,” he said. There was no plan by the department as of Monday evening on how to handle an “Occupy” protest. <Government>There is nothing to prohibit the occupation of a public space, Hansen said, even overnight./>
“High visibility is a must,” UMD student Tony Boicourt said. <Camp>Some in the group said they didn’t want to be so publically disruptive that they alienate those who might be willing to join them. Boicourt said being “Minnesota Nice” wasn’t an option. “We want to be seen and we need to be heard.”/>
The group discussion included talk of mini-protests in front of downtown banks to drive points home.
“Civil disobedience is up to the individual,” Nord said. “The risk is yours.”
Dan O’Neill, president of the Duluth AFL-CIO Central Labor Body, spoke to the group and said <Camp>labor unions were likely to support the rally./>
Some of those at the park Monday night attended a vigil earlier on the steps of the Federal Building in Duluth. It was an effort to show support for the American Jobs Act introduced by President Obama in September.
The White House estimates that 2,355 jobs could be created in the 8th Congressional District. The plan is being debated in Congress this week. The 14 people at the vigil were urging U.S. Rep. Chip Cravaack to support the jobs act.
<Camp>Occupy Duluth has a Facebook page />and will work harder to let people know how they can get involved. One person at the meeting said<Useless> a group is forming in Superior as well./>
