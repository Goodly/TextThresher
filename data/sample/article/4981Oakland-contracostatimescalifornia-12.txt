<2><Protester>7:43 p.m. Protesters hit by car/></>
<2><Protester>Protesters marching from Frank Ogawa Plaza to the Port of Oakland have been hit/></>
<2><Protester>by a car./></> The extent of their injuries is unknown.
<Protester>7:40 p.m. Protesters set up driver check points at port/>
<Protester>The intersection at Seventh and Maritime streets is almost like a rebel/>
<Protester>checkpoint. Every car that comes through is stopped while protesters question/>
<Protester>the driver, then debate with the larger group about whether they should be/>
<Protester>allowed to pass./>
<Protester>"He's a worker," a protester at a car will shout to the group. "He's trying to/>
<Protester>get home."/>
<Protester>Then, they await the larger answer: "Let him go through," the crowd replies, and/>
<Protester>the driver is allowed on his or her way./>
<Protester>Protesters, however, are refusing to let television news trucks through./>
"They work for the 1 percent," the crowd will shout. "We can tell our own
story."

<Protester>7:35 p.m. Protesters try to block news truck from leaving/>
<Protester>At Seventh and Maritime streets/>, protesters argued briefly over whether to let a
CBS5 news truck leave the port, with several protesters blocking the path.
Others are urging them to let the truck leave.
<Opinionor>7:25 p.m. Google map corrected/>
<Opinionor>Frank Ogawa Plaza is no longer called "Oscar Grant Plaza" on Google maps. The/>
<Opinionor>change was apparently a user contribution that has since been corrected./>
7:18 p.m. Port workers try to arrive for night shift
The Pacific Maritime Association requested 200 stevedores to work the night
shift at the port, and those workers are making every attempt to get work, said
Craig Merriless, spokesman for the International Longshore and Warehouse Union.
<Protester>7:15 p.m.: Stragglers continue to head toward port/>
<Protester>At 14th and Broadway, a drum circle and a truck begin heading east on Broadway,/>
<Protester>with the intention of circling around City Hall, then heading toward the port./>
<Protester>Hundreds are following./>
<Protester>7:01 p.m. Port workers try to leave/>
<Protester>Some port workers express visible support for the strike while others became/>
<Protester>entangled with testy exchanges with the protesters as the workers tried to leave/>
<Protester>the port./>
At Maritime Street and Middle Harbor Road,<Protester> one truck driver said he was angered/>
<Protester>by the dozen people who had occupied the roof of his trailer/>. His shift began at
4 a.m. and he wanted to get home to San Jose.
"It's his truck. He's not the problem," said protester Erica Lee, who works at a
coffee import business in West Oakland.
Another protester yelled for the people on the trailer to get off, expanding
that the driver was paid by a truckload and they should not alienate the port
workers.
<Protester>The crowd, however, was only getting larger />and it appeared the driver would be
stuck there for several hours. <Protester>A brass band played on the street outside/> and one
sign carried up to the trailer said, <Opinionor>"Be excellent to each other."/>
"There are some truckers that are probably pretty cool with it," Lee said. "I
saw some who were stoked. But some people are probably getting annoyed."

<Protester>6 p.m. Port entrance/>
<Protester>About 3,000 of people were stopped at the port entrance for about 40 minutes,/>
