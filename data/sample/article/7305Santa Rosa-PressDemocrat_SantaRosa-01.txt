<Protester>Citibank, next door to Wells Fargo on B Street, shut its doors about the same time, ahead of its scheduled 2 p.m. closing time./>
<Opinionor>The Occupy movement in Santa Rosa and other communities around the nation has directed frustration at the disproportionate power and wealth of the nation's elite, what the protesters call the 1 percent./>
Saturday's Bank Transfer Day began as a separate protest to a proposed hike in Bank of America's debit card fees, an increase since rescinded.
But it recently has been heralded both by Occupy groups and credit unions as an effective stategy to wield economic power for social change.
<Protester>Demonstrators chanted/><Opinionor> “Luther Burbank, not Wells Fargo,”/><Protester>in front of Wells Fargo at Third and B Streets. />Luther Burbank Savings is the largest locally based financial institution in Sonoma County.
<Opinionor>A typical sign read “Move Your Money.” Others spelled out support specifically for Redwood and Community First credit unions, two local institutions./>

<Protester>Picket lines were set up near each bank's front doors, but customers were still allowed to enter the businesses. Santa Rosa police officers monitored the demonstrations./>
At Bank of America, Occupy supporter Jaime Delgado, 28, said he had closed his account that morning and planned to move his money to Exchange Bank. He's back at Santa Rosa Junior College planning to study film, and he still remembers receiving a Doyle Scholarship as a student there years earlier. Exchange Bank sponsors the long-standing scholarship, which was halted in 2008 after the bank suspended its dividend, the sole source of financing the awards. The bank has said it hopes to reinstate the scholarship when profits allow it to do so.
<Opinionor>“I just feel they'll do better with our money,” Delgado said of Exchange Bank./>

<Protester>Wells Fargo spokesman Ruben Pulido called it unfortunate that the disruption inside had denied bank customers their ability to conduct business./>
<Protester>About 1:30 p.m., Citibank customer Sterling Magnell arrived at the B Street branch to find the doors locked. Instead of entering, he used the automatic teller machine outside./>
<Protester>Magnell said the idea of calling for social change was “pretty cool,” but he also wants people to accept responsibility for their part in improving their financial welfare./>
<Protester>Of the bank transfers, he said, “We'll see if it makes any difference.”/>
