Occupy Richmond: Swift
Farid Alan Schintzius, left, talks with Richmond Mayor Dwight C. Jones as Jones entered Kanawa Plaza in downtown Richmond.
<Government>Last week Mayor Dwight Jones visited Kanawha Plaza to chat with the members of Occupy Richmond camped out there. />The spirit of Jonathan Swift pervaded the scene.
When Jones invited leaders to meet with him, a spokesman told him that the non-hierarchical movement lacks leaders. The explanation came from the person who <Strategy>greeted Jones by saying, "Welcome to our home." />Others can decide whether the greeter qualifies as a leader.
When Jones started addressing the occupiers, the gathering resorted to the "people's mic" in which groups of people repeat an orator's words one clause at a time. The device would rob Barack Obama of his eloquence.
The Occupy protesters lack a discernable agenda, which may be to their benefit. The U.S. mainstream almost certainly would reject a formal platform.
A modern day Swift could write classic satire only by reporting the news.
