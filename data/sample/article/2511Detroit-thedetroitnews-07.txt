Occupy Detroit asks for eviction delay


Detroit -<Info> Occupy Detroit learns today if the City Council will grant its request to stay longer in Grand Circus Park./><Legal_Action> [ its request to stay longer in Grand Circus Park.] /><Camp>[Grand Circus Park.] />
Members of the movement also are seeking housing for the winter while still protesting in the city.
<Camp>The group wanted to stay in Grand Circus Park, where they've been living since Oct. 14, /><Protester>[where they've been living since Oct. 14,] /><Camp> after their 30-day permit was set to expire at 10 p.m. Monday./>
The occupiers - inspired by the protests on Wall Street and elsewhere seeking social, political and economic change - are hoping for a two-week extension so they can clean up the park.
"We need a little time. <Strategy>We want to leave in a peaceful and orderly manner,"/> said Sarah Coffey, a member of Occupy Detroit.
<Legal_Action>The group began the appeal process Monday morning before the city's public health and safety committee, and met with the City Council to seek the extension./>
Lee Gaddies, a member of the movement's media team, said the minimum extension the group could request was two weeks, but they plan to be out within the next few days.
<Info>Council members set a vote on the extension for today,/><Legal_Action> but on Monday, theyappeared ready to approve the request./>
<Legal_Action>"I am for extending the agreement," Councilwoman Brenda Jones said./>
<Legal_Action>Added Council President Pro-tem Gary Brown: "We're trying to find a resolution that will meet all" parties' needs./>
During the meeting, <Police>Deputy Police Chief James Tolbert />heeded the advice of the council <Police>and said there were no plans for arrests or evictions when the permit expired./>
<Strategy>Members said city police have been helpful since the encampment began and don't fear the possibility of raids />similar to those recently in Portland, Ore., and Oakland, Calif.
"I don't think people are worried. I think we'll be fine," said Juan Martinez, 35, of Detroit. "No matter what happens, we've got contingency plans for everybody."
The group has three locations where it will move when the time comes. T<Camp>here's office space on Woodward in Detroit's downtown and a warehouse and 50-unit hotel in southwest Detroit, all of which have been donated to the group./>
Some members of the group moved supplies from camp to the other locations last weekend.
<Camp>At a general assembly meeting Monday night in Grand Circus Park, many members approved a proposal to keep the southwest Detroit location as a meeting place during the winter./>
They pushed for that because the space wouldn't be able to double as housing for all members, Coffey said.
The group is exploring other housing options to keep members together - especially for members who might not have anywhere else to go, she said. "We want to keep people involved ... so they continue organizing."
Having a presence in the city helps the movement's "activism and mass mobilization that is going to drive the reform of America," said Zachary Steve, another Occupy member.
