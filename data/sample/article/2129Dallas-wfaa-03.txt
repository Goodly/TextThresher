<Government>Here is the text of the statement which was relayed by the city's public information office at 7:47 p.m.:/>
<Camp>The City had an agreement with Occupy Dallas to remain on the public property provided standard insurance coverage was obtained. The group did not meet the insurance requirements per the agreement. Therefore, the agreement is no longer applicable. /><Government>The City will begin enforcing local laws (for example: park curfews and sleeping in public)/>
No timetable was given, and it was not immediately clear whether protesters at Pioneer Plaza will be asked to leave or if they will be forcibly evicted from the park in front of the Dallas Convention Center.
A spokesperon for the city said the protesters could be warned, receive citations, or arrested.

<Camp>In a special permit issued Monday, the city gave the protesters permission to remain at the park until 5 p.m. Friday, but that was contingent upon receipt of a $1 million liability insurance policy./>
<Camp>Cameron Gray, the attorney for Occupy Dallas, said he was unable to find a company that would provide insurance for the group./>
<Legal_Action>He is requesting a temporary restraining order to prevent the city from making arrests for what he called exercising their First Amendment rights./>
