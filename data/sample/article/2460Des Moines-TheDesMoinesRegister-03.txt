Covering Ron Paul                
                         
<Protester>Five Occupy Des Moines members were arrested in Ankeny this morning after blocking the doors to Ron Paul’s Iowa presidential headquarters, />said Drew Ivers, the congressman’s state campaign chairman.
<Camp>A press release from the movement said/><Strategy> that those gathered were protesting Paul’s anti-abortion stance, as well as his plans to make cuts to the Department of Education and the Environmental Protection Agency./>
<Protester>Ivers said the Occupiers arrived at the office, a suite located at 207 NE Delaware Ave., around 8 a.m. and were dispersed within a couple of hours./>
<Protester>The property’s landlord — not campaign staffers — called police to the scene/>, Ivers said.
<Protester>“A little more than a half dozen” protesters showed up in total/>, he added.
<Protester>“(The Ankeny Police) asked them to leave; they chose not to,” Ivers said. “I think a few were arrested and taken away. />So there was no disturbance in terms of everything continued on without a hitch inside the office.”
Campaign operations were not interrupted and the Occupiers did not enter the office. The campaign routinely keeps its doors locked, even during business hours, Ivers.
“They were rather mild. They didn’t get violent by any means,” he said of the protesters. “It didn’t stop anything because we standardly keep the door closed.”
Paul addressed the issue this morning after WHO radio’s Jan Mickelson informed him during a live interview that his Iowa office was the site of a protest. Occupy Des Moines members protested at former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s Iowa headquarters Wednesday.
“I didn’t even hear that yet,” said Paul, whose has had Occupy Des Moines members attend past campaign events. “It must not have been a big enough deal yet for them to tell me.”
The congressman went on to say he thinks there are parts of his libertarian message that would resonate with those involved in the Occupy movement.
<Opinionor>“They don’t like the bailouts and I don’t like the bailouts; so there are some things that we can agree on,” he said. “I think the tea party movement and the Occupy movement are motivated for different reasons, but they come together because they don’t trust government anymore, and that’s why I think I can connect with both groups.”/>
Paul has a full day of campaigning ahead of him with town hall meetings planned in Perry, Atlantic and Council Bluffs.
