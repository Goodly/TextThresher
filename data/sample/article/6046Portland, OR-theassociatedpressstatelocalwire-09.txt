<Protester>Port of Portland closes 2 terminals after arrests/>
<Protester>The Port of Portland shut down two of its four terminals on Monday after police arrested two people and seized weapons in the hours before a demonstration by the Anti-Wall Street movement./>
<Protester>Security concerns were raised when police found the suspects in camouflage clothing with a gun, sword and walkie-talkies who said they were doing reconnaissance./>
<Protester>Kari Koch, a spokeswoman for Occupy Portland, said the two people taken into custody were not part of the demonstration./>
<Protester>"We do not send out folks with guns," Koch said./>
Limited operations continued throughout the day at the port's two other terminals.
Operators of Terminal 6, one of the facilities shut down, planned to keep it closed until 8 a.m. Tuesday due to concerns about worker safety, said Mark Price, assistant manager of International Container Terminal Services Inc. in Oregon.
The decision to shut down the two terminals was relayed to about <Protester>200 workers from the longshoremen's union, which said it sympathized with the goals of the Occupy movement but disagreed with shutting down operations that would deprive its members of pay./>
Police did not immediately identify the two suspects or say what charges they might face.
Port officials erected fences and told workers to stay home, port spokesman Josh Thomas said.
<Protester>The full economic impact of the move was not yet known, he said./>
"We're talking about tenants, customers, truckers, rail providers, a pretty far-reaching group, and most of these people are not employed by the port," Thomas said. "To say it's going to be X amount of dollars right now is impossible."
Thomas said work involving four vessels was postponed, and customers were calling to complain.
"We share their frustration," Thomas said. "It's not an ideal situation and it's also in part misguided and counterproductive."
A couple of hundred protesters blocked semitrailers from making deliveries at the two major terminals, one that handles grain and potash exports and the other for container imports and exports.
Businesses that lease space from the port at two other terminals were conducting limited operations.
<Protester>About 100 people stood at Terminal 5, with 12 police officers on bicycles between the protesters and the street. Passing trucks occasionally honked their horns, and a few that tried to enter the terminal were let through./>
<Protester>Protesters said the trucks allowed to pass were not serving one of the organizations targeted by the demonstration./>
<Opinionor>Gov. John Kitzhaber said almost 5,000 Oregon companies depend on exports and employ thousands of people who are part of the so-called 99 percent that the Occupy Wall Street protests purport to represent./>
<Opinionor>"In trying to force a public debate and I cheer the public debate, I think it's important I think the movement does some damage to the people that it's ostensibly trying to" help, Kitzhaber told reporters at a gathering of business and political leaders in Portland./>
The protest took on a carnival atmosphere after participants decided police weren't a threat<Protester>. Three people juggled oranges, a man gyrated within a hula-hoop, and an accordionist accompanied by a man beating an empty plastic bucket kept up a steady patter./>
<Protester>Protesters set their sights on two West Coast companies port operator SSA Marine and grain exporter EGT./>
<Protester>Giant investment firm Goldman Sachs owns a major stake in SSA Marine and has been a frequent target of protesters./>
Robert Walker, 19, said he was unsure where the protest was heading.
"That's the power of this whole thing, that it's spontaneous," he said.
Officers making a traffic stop found the gun with ammunition clips and other items in a car carrying two men who said they were an advance team for the demonstration, police Lt. Robert King said. A 26-year-old man was driving with a suspended license, and a 27-year-old passenger was wanted for a parole violation, he said.
Koch also disavowed a man who police said was driving a stolen vehicle to the demonstration.
