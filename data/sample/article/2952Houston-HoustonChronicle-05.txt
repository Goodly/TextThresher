<ToBe>He fired into the air before heading over to a nearby pedestrian bridge, firing into a pond and pointing the weapon at people in the park, police said./>
<ToBe>Two HPD special operation bike patrol officers arrived quickly and told Twohig to drop the weapon, but he refused and said, "Shoot me! Shoot me!" according to witnesses and police./>
<ToBe>A witness started recording the incident, and police said the video shows the gunman standing on the bridge over the pond, holding a gun to his head. Police yelled at the gunman to drop his weapon, but he moved toward them, according to police./>
<ToBe>The officers fired at Twohig, and he fell to the ground, but he stood back up and reached for his rifle and was shot again, police said. None of his injuries was life threatening./>
<ToBe>No one else was injured./>
<ToBe>Twohig was charged with aggravated assault on a public servant, a felony, according to court records./> He did not yet have an attorney listed Tuesday morning.
<Camp>Occupy Houston volunteers issued a statement saying />the gunman was "not a recognized participant in Occupy Houston, nor has he been determined to have any affiliation with any of its members."
"At this time, Occupy Houston is not speculating on the motives of the gunman, but we extend our sympathies to the seemingly troubled young man who perpetrated (Monday's) act of violence," the statement said. "We are thankful that no one other than the assailant was injured, and <Strategy>we extend our gratitude to the officers on scene who reacted quickly and with the appropriate amount of force as dictated by the situation."/>
