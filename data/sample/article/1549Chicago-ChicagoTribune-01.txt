Staging a protest — on a makeshift stage
Outdoor reworking of 'A Christmas Carol' makes use of actors who have been drawn into the protest movement
December 24, 2011|By Barbara Brotman, Chicago Tribune reporter


The audience members began to arrive, walking behind a man carrying a sign reading, "Where are the jobs created by the tax cuts for the wealthy?"
Occupy Chicago was putting on a show.
The set was ready.<Protester> In front of the memorial to Abraham Lincoln in Grant Park/>, a bench was hammered onto pieces of plywood to keep it from being blown over. Rolling wardrobes on the sides were anchored against the wind by backpacks. Scene lists were duct-taped to the tall columns on each side.
"I like that Abe Lincoln is looking over us," said Teresa Veramendi, looking up at the president's somber, seated figure. "I think he would approve."
<Protester>"Occupy My Heart: A Revolutionary Christmas Carol," by writer-activist William Turck,/> is a modern take on Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol":
On a cold, snowy Christmas Eve, an ambitious Chicago banker loses his job and his money-hungry girlfriend, encounters a former love who is part of the Occupy movement, is visited by three spirits who show him painful truths, and finds redemption.
"It really stays pretty true to the classic Dickens tale of somebody who has sold out all their values to the pursuit of money and isn't really happy," said Zach Johnson-Dunlop, 28, who plays the banker.
The action is set amid a protest, and last week it was seen by audience members who had just come from one. The premiere — <Protester>a single outdoor performance Friday afternoon/> — was coordinated to begin <2><Protester>at the end of a protest march that set out from LaSalle and Jackson./></>
<Protester>The small and chilled crowd, joined by several perplexed tourists/>, watched and occasionally participated, to director Hannah Friedman's delight.
The actors gently shooed away a man who had walked on stage to take close-up pictures of what he thought was a real TV newscast but was actually part of the show. And one Occupy regular kept joining the actors portraying protesters in the show.
<Useless>Turck conceived of the play just before Thanksgiving. As he attended Occupy Chicago's general assemblies, he was struck by how many theater people he was meeting./>
<Useless>"I thought, 'Boy, if we could channel this talent, there's no better form of communication, heart to heart, than art,'" he said./>
<Useless>Christmas was a little more than a month away. And Turck happened to be a great fan of Dickens./>
<Useless>"On DVD somewhere, I've got just about every version of 'A Christmas Carol,'" he said./>
<Useless>Turck had his concept. He banged out the script in a week, returned to Occupy's general assembly "and tried to convince people I was sane."/>
<Useless>"He jumped up and said, 'I have written a play,'" said Veramendi, 26, an actress who teaches theater in Chicago schools. "People were very excited. … Everyone cheered./>


<Useless>"It's a great/><Useless> vehicle/><Useless> to get people interested and to bring more people into the conversation who might not come out to a protest — but who might come to a play."/>
<Useless>Friedman, 22, who has been an assistant director and stage manager at Lookingglass Theatre Company, Piven Theatre Workshop and Chicago Dramatists, saw a notice on a Chicago theater website asking for actors and a director for an Occupy play. She met with Turck and Veramendi./>
<Useless>"I got a chance to read the script, and I really liked it a lot," Friedman said. "He's taken this classic — it's almost become an icon in American culture — and turned it into a revolutionary story."/>
<Useless>Turck's version differs in one important respect. "Our banker, Josh, is a likable character. He's not Scrooge," he said. "His arguments are compelling./>
<Useless>"We tried to be very realistic. We didn't want to be cartoonish. We really wanted people to think."/>
<Useless>On Friday, actors changed costumes — all of which included coats — on stage, in the open. No one used mics, and though/><Useless> traffic/><Useless> hummed, sirens yowled and trains whistled, the actors generally made themselves heard./>
<Useless>The audience, standing behind or sitting on the steps up to the memorial, chanted along with the play's protesters and tried to stay warm. One young man passed out chemical hand warmers; another, cookies./>
<Useless>At the end, people wiggled upward-raised fingers, an Occupy expression of approval, and gave enthusiastic reviews./>
<Useless>"It was funny, but it also had real events and actions. And I liked the turnaround of the main character," said Ryan Griffin, who added powerful praise for an outdoor performance in winter:/>
<Useless>"I was really getting cold, and I wanted to get out of here. But I really wanted to see the play."/>
<Info>"Occupy My Heart" will be performed indoors, for free, at 8 p.m. Monday at the Prop Theater, 3502-04 N. Elston Ave., and at 8 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday at Studio BE, 3110 N. Sheffield Ave./>
<Info>A radio play the cast recorded was to be broadcast at 10 a.m. Saturday on WCPT, 820 AM, during Marshall Stern's "Awakened America" program. A podcast of the show was scheduled to be posted soon at bit.ly/uH3oBb./>
