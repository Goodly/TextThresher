<Strategy>"I think it had to be done I support her fully in terms of trying to stop folks from taking up encampment on the grounds I think sleeping on the grounds goes too far," /><Government>said Rep. Rick Quinn, a Republican who represents Lexington County. />

<Strategy>Quinn says he thinks not allowing the protester at the state house even at night could create a free speech problem./>
<Strategy>"I think what Gov. Haley did in terms of making it so they can't sleep on the grounds and take up residence was absolutely the right thing to do, I support her. I just may have do it a bit differently," said Quinn. "I'm not a lawyer, but I believe that there could be some problems with the idea that you're not gonna allow American citizens to assemble, it's a close call."/>
<Government>Democratic State Representative Boyd Brown says/><Strategy> he hadn't paid much attention to the Occupy Columbia movement until Haley gave the group two hours to move from the state house grounds, he says, violating their rights. />
<Strategy>"You have first amendment rights in this country and it's so important the framers of our Constitution made it the first amendment and what we saw yesterday was a governor trample all over first amendments," he said./>
<Strategy>Brown also believes the governor timed the eviction to take the spotlight off her as the State Ethics /><Strategy>Commissio/>n<Strategy> approved rules to require political candidates to record the value of flights by the hourly operating costs of planes. The issue came from questions of the governor's use of planes to travel and raise money for her campaign./>
<Strategy>"I think it's blatantly obvious that yesterday was the day the ethics commission came out and slammed her for unethical use of private aircraft and I think she needed a distraction to keep that out the news," said Brown./>
<Government>Haley's press secretary, Rob Godfrey, responded saying, /><Strategy>"some things, and some people, are so foolish they aren't worth responding to."/>
