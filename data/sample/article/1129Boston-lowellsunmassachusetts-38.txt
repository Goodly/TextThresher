<Opinionor>Has anyone noticed if Boston Mayor Thomas Menino has been wearing a red coat lately?/> <Strategy>Menino supported the arrests of 141 Occupy Boston protesters for reportedly harming some grass on the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway./><Police> [ the arrests of 141 Occupy Boston protesters for reportedly harming some grass on the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway] /><Strategy>He quipped that "civil disobedience will not be tolerated."/><Opinionor> Sounds like Menino would surely have sided with the British Loyalists if he lived during the time of the American Revolution./>
<Opinionor>Could someone please show Mayor Menino Article VII of the Massachusetts Constitution? It states:/>
<Opinionor>"Government is instituted for the common good; for the protection, safety, prosperity and happiness of the people; and not for the profit, honor, or private interest of any one man, family, or class of men: Therefore the people alone have an incontestable, unalienable, and indefeasible right to institute government; and to reform, alter, or totally change the same, when their protection, safety, prosperity and happiness require it."/>
<Useless>In New Hampshire's Constitution, Article 10 is titled "Right of Revolution." The article is similar to Massachusetts Article VII. However, in N.H., revolution is not only a right of the people, but a duty of the people to reform government when necessary. The N.H. Constitution states: "The doctrine of nonresistance against arbitrary power, and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive of the good and happiness of mankind."/>
<Useless>Mayor Menino needs to make a public apology to the people for his treasonous words. /><Opinionor>Arresting peaceful protesters in Boston -- the birthplace of the American Revolution -- is disgraceful./>
