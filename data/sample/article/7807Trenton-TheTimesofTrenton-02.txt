<Camp>Less than a dozen protesters/> man the camp at Occupy Trenton, a much smaller off-shoot of Occupy Wall Street, which set up shop at the<Camp> New Jersey World War II Memorial, directly across the street from the Statehouse./>
TRENTON — Hand sanitizer, toothpaste and a few rolls of toilet paper on a card table make up the <Camp>medical station./>
The <Camp>media and tech stand/> consists of a flip cam and a few old computers plugged into a <Camp>power strip./>
The<Camp> food station/> offers bottled water, snacks and fruit.
There are no marches, no chants, and <Police>no police presence at Occupy Trenton/>, a small but resolute offshoot of the anti-Wall Street protests that began last month in New York.
They may have fewer resources and a fraction of the manpower compared to the protest in Manhattan’s Zuccoti Park, but the Trenton occupiers say they are just as passionate — and committed for the long haul.
<Opinionor>"This is the place to be. If we’re going to get anybody’s attention, /><Strategy>across from the Statehouse would be the place,"/><Opinionor> said Maureen Rose-Ice, 49, of Jackson. "The long-term goal is to be acknowledged by the people who are in control."/>
The <Camp>two dozen protesters at the state’s World War II Memorial/> have <Strategy>grievances for Trenton Mayor Tony Mack and President Obama/> — and lots of people in between. Some are <Strategy>upset about cuts to the Trenton police force./><Opinionor> Others feel state budget cuts have harmed education. And they share the anger expressed at other camps over government bailouts on Wall Street./>
Charlene Dow Edwards, a Trenton resident who held a sign reading<Strategy> "108 Trenton cops are gone. Join us," said budget cuts at the state and local level motivated her to protest./>
<Strategy>"We need to be here every day all day to confront them," she said, referring to state officials. "They can feel a little uncomfortable going to work every day. Because it’s really uncomfortable out here."/>
<Useless>Since the Occupy Wall Street protests set up shop, hundreds of smaller occupations have cropped up across the nation. The movement includes more than 1,300 groups, according to the Occupy Together website./>
Beth Leech, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said the expansion of Occupy Wall Street mirrors the civil rights movement, which spread from the Southern Leadership Council to copycat sit-ins and protests across the nation. <Opinionor>"You’ll see replication of what’s happened in one place happen in another," Leech said. "These are people who are upset for a variety of reasons. They’re coming out to express their frustration pretty organically."/>

<Protester>The protesters set up camp in Trenton on Thursday, />complete with <Camp>sleeping bags,/> signs bemoaning corporate greed and <Camp>designated areas: "administration," "art," "comfort" and "sanitation." About a dozen slept at the memorial Monday night/>, and more have shown up each day. The protesters are confident their movement will grow.
<Camp>On Monday afternoon, about 20 people stood near the edge of West State Street, across from the Statehouse, and waved signs/> reading <Opinionor>"Honk for peace, equality and reform," "99 percent want our country back," and "Save the American dream."/><Camp> One out of every few drivers honked in support,/> drawing cheers from the occupiers, who ranged in <Camp>age from 17 to 63./>
<Camp>Edward Anthony Salter, 29, who helped organize the occupation/>,<Strategy> said State Police and the Department of Military and Veteran’s Affairs, which oversees the World War II memorial, have been cooperative and friendly./><Useless> Though arrests have marked protests in New York and Boston, /><Camp>there has been no tension in Trenton./>
<Opinionor>"We’re all part of the 99 percent," Salter said./>
