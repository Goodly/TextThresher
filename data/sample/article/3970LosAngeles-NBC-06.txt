"We saw unfortunately the Senate vote the whole thing down," said Wyatt Closs, SEIU-ULTCW. "But there are many pieces that could get acted on right now that would make a real difference within a very short period of time and get the economy going again."
For Juan Jose Gutierrez of <Protester>the Full Rights for Immigration Coalition, />there is solidarity with an added touch.
<Opinionor>"As the movement begins to articulate the actual specific demands that we are going to be working towards resolving, one of the ones we think needs to be on that eventual list is comprehensive immigration reform,"/> said Gutierrez.
If the focus is immigration, then what happens to the common cries of 99 percent and job creation? Gutierrez sees the unification of different voices as a positive for all involved.
<Opinionor>"Occupy LA provides the stage to bring together the various sectors of society that has serious issues to deal with," said Gutierrez. "I think it also provides an opportunity for all of us to realize in the end we are all in this together."/>
There may be no solid end in sight, but Occupy LA protestors say the growing movement is proof that people are tired of talk and yearning for change.
