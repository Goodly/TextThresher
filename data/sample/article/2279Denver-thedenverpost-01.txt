The Denver district attorney's office will not pursue felony charges against an Occupy Denver protester arrested during <ToBe>an Oct. 29 clash with police in Civic Center/>.
Soon after the incident, John Sexton, 33, was identified by Denver police and witnesses as having pushed a police motorcycle and assaulted an officer, but he was cleared of those allegations Monday.
"Our review of the facts determined that the case wasn't appropriate for a state felony charge, and we have referred it back to the city attorney's office for a possible city-ordinance violation," said Lynn Kimbrough, spokeswoman for the Denver district attorney's office.
If it is determined that Sexton violated a city ordinance, he will face a small fine.
Sexton wasn't the only Occupy Denver protester in court Monday. Two protesters arrested during Sunday's altercation with police had bail set at $5,000 and remain in jail pending an investigation by the DA's office.
Chief Deputy District Attorney Matt Wenig appeared at Monday's hearing and requested that Corey Donahue's bail be increased from the scheduled $3,000, citing an increase in "frequency and severity" of the allegations against him.
Donahue has been arrested on at least two other occasions in the past month during Occupy Denver's weekend protests and is <Camp>a visible leader in the collective known as the "Thunderdome."/>
<Camp>The collective, now independent of the Occupy Denver movement itself, is composed predominantly of members of the Denver Anarchist Black Cross. They continue to participate in Occupy Denver general assemblies and rallies in spite of ideological differences with the Occupy Wall Street movement./>
