<Protester>Long Beach residents and community organizers took to the streets and gathered at Lincoln Park in the city’s downtown district last weekend to protest in solidarity with the Occupy Together movement/>. <Police>The Occupy Long Beach events culminated on Sunday with two arrests and two other citations after a number of participants came to disagreements with the police officers who attempted to usher them out of the public park./>
The purpose of the non-violent, non-partisan movement, which continues to spread across the country, is to protest corporate greed. Following the Declaration of the Occupation of New York City document and intending to help represent the disadvantaged “99 percent” majority that is suffering from an unfair global economy, the hundreds of sign-wielding protestors chanted and expressed their concerns over the “one percent” of corporate America that they believe have come to run the government.
