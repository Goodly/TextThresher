From JM via iPhone:
Yo YoVenice,
<Camp>Some crazy woman is trying to shut down Occupy Venice by saying we left our trash and abandoned our stuff at Windward Circle saying she is making calls to have our stuff thrown away and have us hassled by the LAPD./> Lies<Camp>. Maybe she came by when we were laying down for a nap. There are 12 people down here now at 4pm. />Please set the record straight for us.
