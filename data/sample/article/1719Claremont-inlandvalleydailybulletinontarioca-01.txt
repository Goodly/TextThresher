<Government>Councilman Opanyi Nasiali requested city staffers prepare an ordinance "that deals with this issue" for future discussion. Nasiali made the request after the council reconvened from closed to open session./>
<Government>Council members were scheduled to discuss in closed session what litigation, if any, could come from making a decision on Occupy Claremont. Nasiali said he didn't feel the non-public session was necessary./>

<Government>On Dec. 8, city officials said protestors "are not in violation of the intent of the (camping) ordinance."/>
<Government>City Attorney Sonia R. Carvalho and Police Chief Paul Cooper examined the camping ordinance in relation to Occupy Claremont./>
