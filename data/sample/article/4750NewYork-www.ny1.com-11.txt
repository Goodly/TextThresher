<Strategy>“The mayor is a strong believer in the First Amendment and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest.

<Strategy>Skeptical demonstrators told NY1 Wednesday night they feared the clean-up will be the first step in their removal./>
<Strategy>"I don't think he will be able to clean this place up. Even if he does, I think the piece that will be lifted up will be the piece that will be planted somewhere else," said one protester./>
<Strategy>"They tried pretty hard to get us before realizing that legally they can't. So, I wouldn't be surprised if they're resorting to other ways to get us to leave," said another protest./>
This was announced hours after <2><Protester>hundreds demonstrated in front of the Downtown Manhattan headquarters of JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday./></>

<Opinionor>"They are making it basically illegal or banning any regulation of a lot of the Wall Street risky financial products that caused our financial crisis in the first place." said Sukiong Hong of Korean Community Development./>
<3><Protester>"We have to ask why Representative Carolyn Maloney and other Democratic representatives are really selling out their constituents today to support this Korea Trade Agreement that will outsource 159,000 jobs to sweatshops," said Adam Weissman of Trade Justice./></>

The three free trade agreements passed Congress on Wednesday.

With their contract set to expire at the end of the year, workers said they should not have their salaries or benefits cut.
<Opinionor>"The economy is perhaps not the best economy we can have," said Local 32BJ Treasurer Hector Figueroa. "The owners are enjoying good profits. The banks are already having record profits. There is no reason why working people in this economy can't get good wages and be treated with dignity."/>
Thousands of other office cleaners in Pennsylvania and Washington were also looking for new contracts, which are set to expire in a few days.
