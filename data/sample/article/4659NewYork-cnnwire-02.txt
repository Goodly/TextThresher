NEW YORK (CNN) --  Protests swelled in cities nation-wide<Protester> Friday,/> as police forces around the country struggled to either corral or remove demonstrators from downtown parks and plazas in the latest development of the month-long "Occupy Wall Street" movement.

<Useless>Colorado State Police patrol spokesman Mike Baker said the demonstration could be broken down into two distinct groups: The first was a part of what he described as the original "Occupy" group, which maintained close communication with law enforcement. The second, he said, was a more "radical" faction. />
<Useless>"These were the ones (police) came into trouble with today," Baker said. />
<Useless>Most in Denver were charged for unlawful conduct on state property, he added, while one other person was charged for simple assault. Another protester was arrested for impeding traffic./>

New York police were not immediately available for comment on the allegation and CNN cannot independently verify the claim.
<Opinionor>Later on Friday, hip hop mogul Russell Simmons called the demonstrations "inspirational."/>
<Opinionor>"People want this country to be better," he told CNN. "They want the money out of Washington," adding that he believed the U.S. government remains largely controlled by corporations. />

<Strategy>Bloomberg added that while he lacked first-hand knowledge of the conversations, he was told the officials generally threatened to "make life more difficult" for the real-estate company. />
<Government>Brookfield Properties issued a statement later Friday saying "a number of local political leaders" requested the cleaning of the park be deferred for "a short period of time."/>
The cancellation averts a broader showdown between authorities and demonstrators, who appeared heartened by news of the cancellation.
<Strategy>"We are winning and Wall Street is afraid,"/><Camp> protester Kira Moyer-Sims said in a written statement distributed by the group/><Strategy>. "This movement is gaining momentum and is too big to fail." />
<Government>Bloomberg's office announced earlier that the real-estate firm withdrew their request made earlier in the week for police assistance during the scheduled clean-up operation. />
<Strategy>"Our position has been consistent throughout: the City's role is to protect public health and safety, to enforce the law, and guarantee the rights of all New Yorkers. Brookfield believes they can work out an arrangement with the protesters that will ensure the park remains clean, safe, available for public use and that the situation is respectful of residents and businesses downtown, and we will continue to monitor the situation,"/><Government> said Deputy Mayor Cas Holloway. />
<Strategy>The demonstrations have been mostly peaceful, though there had been fears of a standoff between police officers tasked with clearing the park and protesters who said they wouldn't budge. />
<Government>City officials in New York had initially ordered the protesters to leave by 7 a.m./>

<Opinionor>"You want to clean up something? Clean up these crooks on Wall Street,"/> <Opinionor>said City Council Member Charles Barron./>
<Government>Councilwoman Letitia James of Brooklyn said/><Strategy> the move to clean the park was a "ruse" to end the protest./>

<Strategy>"The mayor is a strong believer in the First Amendment and believes that the protesters have a right to continue to protest,"/><Government> Holloway said in an earlier statement. />
<Strategy>But the situation in the park is "not in the best interests of the protesters, residents or the city," he said./>
