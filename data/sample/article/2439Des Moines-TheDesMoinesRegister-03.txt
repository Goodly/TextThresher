Demonstrators say no more protests are planned at <Protester>two prominent Democratic Party sites in Des Moines after eight people were arrested Monday./>
But group members could change their minds at any time, representatives of Occupy Des Moines said, and tactics like those that preceded the arrests are planned for large-scale rallies starting next week at Republican presidential candidate campaign offices in central Iowa.
<Opinionor>Occupy Des Moines, in its attempts to bring attention to the disparity between rich and poor Americans,/> has organized rallies at banks and other locations <Camp>since October/>, most lasting only a few hours.
<Protester>But on Saturday, after a pair of protests at President Barack Obama’s Des Moines campaign office at 621 E. Second St., />some group members vowed to remain there until their demands for the president to reject certain legislation were met.
<Protester>They couldn’t get inside the office, though,/><2><Protester> and about 11 a.m. Monday protesters moved to Iowa Democratic Party headquarters at 5661 Fleur Drive./></>
“They don’t want to be here to listen to us; we decided to go to the state headquarters <2><Protester>and make them listen to us,” said Daniel Bragg of Occupy Des Moines./></>
<2><Protester>Police told 12 protesters that they could either leave or be arrested. Eight people, whose hands were zip-tied behind their backs, were placed in a police wagon and transported to the Des Moines police station at around 2 p.m., /></>where they were cited and released.
Each was to be charged with <2><Protester>criminal trespassing,/></> a misdemeanor. They did not resist arrest.
“While we recognize their right to lawful protests, an occupation of our office is not acceptable and only interferes with the work we do to elect Democrats and build a better future for Iowa and our nation,” party Executive Director Norm Sterzenbach said in a prepared statement.
Demonstrators said that despite the arrests, they were pleased with the response they received from Democratic Party employees who permitted them to share concerns and read a prepared statement about legislation that would, among many other things, trim education spending and authorize a pipeline passing through Plains states.
Karen Jenson, a New Yorker who was visiting family and wanted to see Occupy Des Moines’ activities, said she was impressed with the protesters’ organization and the respect shown by demonstrators and party employees.
“They didn’t call police right away — they listened to what we had to say,” Jenson said. “They did make it clear that they would call the police.”
There are no plans to re-occupy the campaign office or the Democrats’ headquarters, Brandon Griffis of Occupy Des Moines said later Monday, but “that doesn’t mean we might not get together and decide to do that within a day or so.”
Griffis said the activities that led up to the arrests are similar to what is expected during <Info>the “People’s Caucus” Dec. 27 and “occupations” of presidential campaign offices from Dec. 27 to Jan. 3. Local demonstrators have invited visitors to come to Iowa and take part in the rallies as the political world focuses on Iowa and its leadoff presidential nominating contest Jan. 3./>
<Strategy>Protesters say they will keep the protests civil, but many have said they will risk arrest./>
“We’re hoping that that’s not the case; we’d love to be able to sit down with the candidates and share the concerns of the 99 percent and have a discourse,” Griffis said.
