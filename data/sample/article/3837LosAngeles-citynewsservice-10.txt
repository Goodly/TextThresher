Occupy L.A. Says It Will Stay At City Hall
LENGTH: 467 words
DATELINE: LOS ANGELES


<Useless>[DT] Organizers of the Occupy L.A. encampment said today they have no plans to leave the area surrounding City Hall, despite recent comments by Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck that it cannot go on indefinitely. />
<Useless>"We have only begun our mission," the Occupy Los Angeles Media Relations Committee said in a statement posted on the website www.OccupyLosAngeles.org. "If L.A. Occupiers eventually exit City Hall, it would be due to Occupy LA's conclusion that our work could be done more efficiently at another location."/>


The group is seeking to draw attention to the growing disparity between the rich and poor.
Unlike other cities where protests are dwindling, <Info>Occupy L.A. is expected to stage one of its largest rallies Thursday morning. A spokesman said more than 1,000 protestors plan to snarl morning rush hour traffic during a downtown march to Bank of America Plaza. />Jacob Hay, with the group Good Jobs L.A., said <Info>marchers expect to be arrested during acts of civil disobedience that could include occupying downtown intersections./>
<Police>Beck told several media outlets Tuesday /><Legal_Action>that police were working with demonstrators on a plan to shut down or move the camp in order to avoid violent clashes between police and protesters /><Useless>that took place in Oakland and New York./>
<Camp>The Occupy L.A. statement cited />reports of <Government>a conference call last week between mayors from nearly a dozen cities to discuss strategies for handling occupy encampments and protests. /><Useless>Oakland Mayor Jean Quan first disclosed the call in an interview with the BBC./>
<Strategy>"This seems to indicate a nationwide effort is under way to close all Occupations," the Occupy L.A. statement said. "We therefore presume the mayor and city council are coordinating planning to ask us to leave."/>
<Government>Villaraigosa did not take part in the conference call and is not colluding with other mayors about how to evict Occupy L.A., press secretary Peter Sanders said./>
<Strategy>"We are following how other cities across the nation are dealing with the various Occupy protests, recognizing that each city has unique challenges and circumstances. In L.A. we continue an ongoing dialogue with the protesters," /><Government>Sanders said/><Strategy>, adding that so far there have been no major incidents to warrant a forced eviction./>
<Camp>The protesters' statement />sought to remind city officials of the <Government>resolution to support the movement approved by the City Council on Oct. 5./>
"<Strategy>At Occupy L.A., we have not been subject to the crack of batons or the sting of pepper spray -- this is as it should be -- we view such weaponry as a complete violation of occupiers' rights as peaceful protesters and we demand such devices not be used on our Occupation," the statement reads./>
<Strategy>"We hold LAPD to a higher standard than we have seen from other cities, if Occupy L.A. refuses to exit City Hall./>"
