Oakland --<Government> Oakland's police union has estimated that last week's sweep of the Occupy Oakland encampment - which re-established itself within days - cost taxpayers more than $1 million./>
But Oakland officials say they do not know how much the city spent to take down <Camp>150 Occupy tents at Frank Ogawa Plaza /><Police>on Oct. 25, clean up the place and then block campers from returning that evening./>
With <Camp>the camp back in full swing/>, the financially strapped city continues spending resources and funds on Occupy, and <Protester>Wednesday's massive demonstration /><Government>will cost the city in public safety overtime, cleanup, lost productivity of city workers and possibly lost sales tax revenue./>
Every city department has been involved with Occupy in one way or another, according to city spokeswoman Karen Boyd. <Government>Homeless-outreach workers have checked on the camp, firefighters have looked for hazards, the finance department is handling various purchases, and the IT department set up an emergency operations center and also dealt with Web threats to the city website. Everyone in the mayor's office is involved./>
<Government>Following the Oct. 25 police raid, about 20 public works employees spent the day cleaning up the plaza at a cost of roughly $4,000. Public works staff said replacing the Frank Ogawa Plaza lawn alone will cost $30,000./>
<Government>Councilman /><Government>Larry Reid/><Government> said that using city resources, including hundreds of police officers - with some from 16 outside agencies - to clear the camp proved to be a waste./> <Strategy>He thinks the city should not have allowed the campers back./>
<Strategy>"What was the purpose of clearing out the area for health and public safety?" Reid said. "We go in, we clean it out, and then we permit them to come back? For what reason?"/>
City department heads are still assessing the costs but have remained tight-lipped about the totals. Boyd said this week that it is too early to calculate the total.
<2><Police>In an open letter to residents Tuesday, the Oakland Police Officers Association/></> <Government>estimated that last week's events cost city taxpayers more than $1 million. Police union spokesman /><Government>Dom Arotzarena/><Government> said the estimate was based on what the union believes the city spent on services, including police overtime, and what the city lost in business./>
<2><Police>The union letter,/></> which <Strategy>criticized Mayor Jean Quan for ordering a sweep and then allowing the campers to return, said police were confused by Quan's mixed messages./>
Boyd said tallying costs is particularly complicated because of the unusual nature of the Occupy encampment and the demonstrations occupiers have spawned.
<Strategy>For earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters, Boyd said, there's an event, a city response and a recovery process. Acts of civil disobedience, on the other hand, usually last no more than a day./>
<Strategy>In the case of the Occupy encampment, "it's not an emergency in the usual way," Boyd said./>
While the costs remain unknown, <Info>the Oakl/><Info>and City Council/><Info> is having a special meeting tonight to discuss the idea of allowing Occupy Oakland to keep its encampment on a long-term basis at the plaza./>
<Info>The proposal by Councilwoman /><Info>Nancy Nadel/><Info>, who represents downtown and West Oakland, asks city departments from police to public works to help the cause. /><Legal_Action>Councilwoman /><Legal_Action>Desley Brooks/><Legal_Action> joined the campground for two nights and confers with its organizers./>
But <Strategy>other council members are adamant the camp must go./>
<Strategy>"It's absolutely unacceptable and irresponsible that we're spending all these resources in downtown ... at the expense of our neighborhoods," said Councilman /><Strategy>Ignacio De La Fuente/>.
