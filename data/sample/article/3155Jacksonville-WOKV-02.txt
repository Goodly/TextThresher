First Coast Tea Party: Occupy movement is "hideous"
JACKSONVILLE, Fla. —


<Info>The Occupy Wall St. movement is garnering plenty of attention, and even making a stop here in Jacksonville on Saturday.  /><Camp>While many are making comparisons between the Occupy movement and the Tea Party, the First Coast Tea Party itself doesn't see it that way./>
<Camp>"We think it's hideous, what they're doing, actually," says Lynne Holicky, policy director for the First Coast Tea Party.  She says they don't subscribe to the idea that there are similarities in the grassroots nature of the Tea Party movement and the Occupy movement./>
<Camp>"There is no comparison between the Tea Party movement and this movement."/>
<Camp>Holicky calls the Occupiers "communists, anarchists, and socialists" and says they're being funded for their protest./>
<Camp>"One of the organizers admitted - it's on the front page of the Washington Post today - that yes, these protesters are being paid.  They're being paid by the unions, they're being paid by George Soros, they're being funded."/>
We can't confirm the accuracy of that statement, but we are checking several sources, including the Occupy movement and the Friday, October 7th edition of the Washington Post.  Holicky says the Tea Party has never been guilty of being funded by outside sources.
"We, the Tea Party, always pay their own dime.  Nobody paid for anybody.  Nobody paid my airfare to come here."
<Info>The Occupy Jax movement kicks off at noon Saturday in Hemming Plaza.  Holicky wasn't specific, but she did hint that there may be counter protests by the Tea Party./>
