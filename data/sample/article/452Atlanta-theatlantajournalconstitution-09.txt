Some of the people waiting to be arrested waved small American flags. About 40 to 50 people remained inside the park after midnight, including Sen. Vincent Fort (D-Atlanta), former Atlanta city councilman Derrick Boazman and Joe Beasley, the southern regional director of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition. Several hundred others were in the street, chanting and carrying signs. />

<Protester>At 10:45 p.m., Tim Franzen, an Occupy Atlanta leader, told participants who wanted to be arrested to gather in a circle in the middle of the park where there was the best lighting for the media to see. He advised people who had been drinking, using drugs or were on probation not to take part. Those who did not want to be arrested but wanted to continue the occupation were told to circle the park until 6 a.m. and then return./>
<Protester>Franzen said arrangement already had been made to cover the bail of group members who were arrested./> They are expected to be charged with violating a city ordinance, a misdemeanor. <2><Police>Fifty additional police officers arrived just after 8 p.m., and Park Place NE alongside the park was barricaded.

<Legal_Action>Mayor Kasim Reed said Monday he wouldn't evict Occupy Atlanta from the park until a group of clergy met with the demonstrators to try to work out a solution./>
