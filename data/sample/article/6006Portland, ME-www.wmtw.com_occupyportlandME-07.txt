PORTLAND, Maine —
<Camp>Portland police made a pair of arrests from unrelated violent incidents that occurred this week at Lincoln Park, the site of the Occupy Maine protest/>.
<Camp>They happened on Thursday and Friday,/> Portland Police Interim Chief Michael Sauschuck said in a released statement.
<Camp>On Thursday, police arrested Jason Carr, 25, on the charge of disorderly conduct. He was arrested around 10:20 p.m. after allegedly pushing and hitting another man, Sauschuck said. The man, who entered the park to voice opposition to Occupy Maine, did not want to pursue assault charges./> Carr has no permanent address.
<Camp>On Friday, police arrested Christopher Schisler, 34, on the charge of aggravated assault after allegedly striking 45-year-old Porter on the head with a hammer, Sauschuck said. Another man, Danny Arnold, 34, was summonsed on the charge of assault for allegedly choking Porter in the incident, which was reported around 7:10 a.m./>
Investigators believe <Camp>Porter started drumming Friday morning to awaken other occupants when several of them became angry about the noise/>. An ambulance took Porter, who is from Portland, to Maine Medical Center in Portland for treatment of his head injury.
Neither Schisler nor Arnold has a permanent address, Sauschuck said.
<Strategy>Occupy Maine released a statement on Friday denouncing the recent violence./>
""The moment that violence erupted, the individuals were no longer acting in alignment with Occupy Maine principals and simultaneously removed themselves from our community," the statement said. <Strategy>"Occupy Maine unequivocally condemns this incident and assert absolute commitment to peace and nonviolence."/>
The two men arrested and the one man summonsed have been told not to return to Lincoln Park, Sauschuck said.
