<Camp>Late Tuesday afternoon, under a dozen protesters were gathered at the intersection of 19th Street and University Avenue,/> in what one of them described as “solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street in New York.”
Ben Terry was one of the protesters with a sign stating, <Opinionor>“SOLD OUT!” over an American flag. />
<Useless>“Cities all over the country are protesting the greed of Wall Street,” Terry said./>
<Useless>Occupy Wall Street is a movement against financial inequality. The movement began in a park in New York two blocks from Wall Street and expanded across the United States, from Florida to Oregon and parts in between./>
<Useless>Those activists in New York say they are angry at what they view as excess of New York financiers. The activists blame these financiers for the economic crisis borne by every day people and throughout the world./>
Terry said he does not expect huge numbers of people to turn out for Occupy Wall Street protests, but he said the people who are connecting under the movement have plans.
<Strategy>In particular, he said many of those protesting in Lubbock are concerned about the homeless problem in the town. />
“Why aren’t we doing something to fix the problem?” Terry asked, adding that the protesters are planning to help those in the “Tent City.”
Another protester, Andrew McMillan, wore a jacket and tie. He said people of all different backgrounds make up the 99 percent of the country that is not economically privileged.
<Camp>“This is to show we are a diverse group,”/> McMillan said. “I can’t be out on Wall Street, so we’re doing what we can with what we’ve got.”
McMillan said <Camp>Lubbock protesters met up through Facebook, where an Occupy Lubbock page grew to more than 400 “Likes” in just one week. />They have also <Camp>registered a domain name, occupylubbock.org./> He said they are part of the larger Occupy Together movement.
“We’re doing this to spread awareness about the Occupy Wall Street movement,” McMillan said.
