SAN FRANCISCO -- <Useless>Growing concerned that mayhem is overwhelming their message,/>
<Useless>weary Occupy members in the Bay Area say police raids on encampments across the/>
<Useless>nation have forced a question: How dependent is the movement on its public/>
<Useless>camps?/>
<Useless>The 2-month-old Occupy movement remains leaderless, but many members have/>
<Useless>expressed a desire to see its focus move to demands for economic reform instead/>
<Useless>of free speech rights and police crackdowns on encampments. Teach-ins at City/>
<Useless>Hall, referendum petition drives and the occupation of neighborhoods and/>
<Useless>foreclosed properties are just some of the ideas being considered as the next/>
<Useless>phase of action./>
<Strategy>"I'm hoping it's not necessary to put down tents again," /><Camp>said Jasper Gregory, a/>
<Camp>member of Occupy Oakland./><Strategy> "I hope that people can organize and come together for/>
<Strategy>a meeting without having to have people down there all the time. If we have to/>
<Strategy>have that encampment, then this can be stopped."/>
<Opinionor>Scott Rossi, 31, a member of Occupy San Francisco, agreed, saying, "We can't/>
<Opinionor>rely on the camps to always be a permanent fixture./>
<Opinionor>"So I think it's time to start thinking of the camps as the dot at the bottom of/>
<Opinionor>an exclamation point, and the rest of the movement as the upstroke. It's time to/>
<Opinionor>draw that line."/>
<Useless>Though the protest began over economic disparity and corporate influence in/>
<Useless>government, Occupy Wall Street has seen much of the media coverage in the past/>
<Useless>month focus on clashes between campers and police, with free speech rights/>
<Useless>stealing the spotlight as the movement's central issue. Occupy Oakland, Occupy/>
<Useless>San Jose and Occupy Cal have seen their encampments forcibly removed by police,/>
<Useless>and many protesters have cited police brutality and infringement on their free/>
<Useless>speech rights. Occupy San Francisco has received many warnings by city officials/>
<Useless>to disband./>
<Useless>"So we're carrying two torches right now: social economic justice and the First/>
<Useless>Amendment stuff," Rossi said. "It's diluted the message."/>
<Useless>Henry Gage Jr., an Occupy San Jose participant, said work never stopped on the/>
<Useless>economic issues, despite the shift in media attention./>
<Useless>"If battles with occupiers and the police fall to the background, more of the/>
<Useless>real story will come out," Gage said. "I think people will be pleasantly/>
<Useless>surprised."/>
<Useless>Despite that, there have been clear problems with public drunkenness, hostility/>
<Useless>and vandalism in the camps./>
<Useless>Police crackdowns might be a blessing, many occupiers say, because even if/>
<Useless>encampments are permanently stymied, the energy they built can be redirected/>
<Useless>onto a clean slate./>
<Useless>Rossi said he believes the energy already generated can sustain the movement,/>
<Useless>especially if organizers continue using Internet tools, such as Twitter and/>
<Useless>InterOccupy.org ./>
<Useless>"This is the first Internet-fueled revolution we've seen," Rossi said./>
There's talk about breaking the encampments into smaller, more
neighborhood-based occupations. "Occupy the Hood" efforts are under way in
Oakland and other cities nationwide.
Talk has also surfaced of shifting the movement indoors or onto private
property.
<Camp>Occupy Oakland members voted days after their/><Police> eviction from Frank H. Ogawa Plaza/>
<Police>on Monday /><Camp>to move to Henry J. Kaiser park, across from the Fox Theater. />Many
protesters see it as a logical step to focus on occupying foreclosed properties.
"I'm sure that can be fairly successful in the suburbs," Rossi said, suggesting
an emphasis on getting families back into their foreclosed homes.
The first example of a<Protester> foreclosure occupation was the short-lived mob takeover/>
<Protester>of a foreclosed downtown building in Oakland that once housed a homeless/>
<Protester>services center./>
"That example was poorly planned and poorly thought-out, which is why it
collapsed," Rossi said.
<Strategy>Should the movement's focus turn to foreclosures, the police response will be/>
<Strategy>even more complex,/><Police> said interim Oakland police Chief Howard Jordan./>
<Strategy>"If they go into a foreclosed home, we have to get the banks or whoever owns the/>
<Strategy>property to agree they don't want them there," Jordan said. "If they're in an/>
<Strategy>open lot, we still have to get owners' permission to remove them. When it's on/>
<Strategy>public property, by comparison, we have a clear reason to arrest them."/>
That distinction opens the door, some occupiers say, to better engaging the
middle class.
<Strategy>"I think the important thing on this is they have the support of the community,"/>
<Strategy>Gregory said. "I think if they take these actions, people need to canvass the/>
<Strategy>neighborhood. We have to knock on doors and say, 'This woman who was your/>
<Strategy>neighbor, we're moving her back in. Are you OK with that?' You have to get the/>
<Strategy>good will of the neighbors. That's vital, crucial to making this work."/>
<Useless>Even if forced occupations fail, other options abound, Gage said. He said he has/>
<Useless>already seen people in San Jose parking their cars in public with tents set up/>
<Useless>on the vehicles' roofs as a signal of solidarity, and he foresees regular/>
<Useless>teach-ins and ballot campaigns surviving the demise of encampments./>
<Useless>But many occupiers and observers say the encampments remain a critical part of/>
<Useless>the movement./>
<Useless>"I've got friends who think this is a disaster, that police have been successful/>
<Useless>in evicting camps, that they're going to neuter the movement because it has lost/>
<Useless>the one thing they had which was predictable: a visible presence," said Robert/>
<Useless>Bulman, a sociology professor at Saint Mary's College in Moraga./>
<Useless>As encampments across the nation become fewer, can the movement survive beyond/>
<Useless>the tents?/>
<Useless>"That's the challenge," Gregory said. "If you do pull up stakes, how do you make/>
<Useless>sure people come back and participate?"/>
