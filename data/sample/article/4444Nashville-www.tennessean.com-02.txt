<Protester>Hundreds of marchers from across Tennessee converged Saturday in Nashville to protest/> <Opinionor>what they see as a country where corporations have more of a voice in government than citizens do./>
<Opinionor>“Occupy Wall Street, Occupy Nashville, occupy everything and never give it back,” /><Protester>protesters chanted during a city-sanctioned march that threaded a six-block loop between the Metro Courthouse and Legislative Plaza/>.
<Useless>The march was one of many held in cities around the country and globe to support the ongoing Occupy Wall Street protests in New York/>. <2><Protester>A small group of protesters in Nashville has been occupying Legislative Plaza for the past week and plans to continue doing so indefinitely./></>
<3><Protester>Before the march came a rally, in which participants took turns sharing their stories. /></><Opinionor>Three generations of the Warren family drove down from Lobelville, Tenn., to say their piece./>
<Opinionor>Michael Warren took his place in the center of the gathering and spoke his piece — the protesters chanting back every sentence so his words carried to the far edges o/>f <3><Protester>the crowd of 200-plus./></>
“<Opinionor>Things are not right, and they don’t appear to be getting better,” said Warren, who wrote to his senators and Rep. Marsha Blackburn but said he received only form letters in response to his story. The family lives in Perry County, where the unemployment rate hit 25 percent in 2009. Warren’s wife and daughter operated a thriving small business that went under when the economy tanked./>
<Opinionor>“We’re doing everything right and we’re getting nowhere,” said his daughter, Emily Weight, whose company, Nana’s Jetpack, sold baby carriers that she and her mother designed and sewed, shipping them to stores around the country. “I’m here because I want some change.”/>
<Opinionor>'Keep it peaceful'/>
<3><Protester>Saturday’s rally was an orderly affair./></> <Protester>Marchers threaded up Deaderick Street to Sixth Avenue, looped around to Union and marched back to the courthouse. There was no visible police presence, and the marchers took pains to stay on the sidewalk and stick to the route outlined on the permit issued by the city./>
<Opinionor>“I feel people here are really sincere about wanting a change for peace and justice,” said Salina Khan of Murfreesboro, who came to the rally with her husband and daughters Fatima, 9, Aleeza, 5, and Sakina Razzaq, 4. The girls colored her protest sign: “United Against Injustice.”/>
<Opinionor>When it was Khan’s turn to speak, she urged the crowd: “Don’t let them divide us by religion, race or social class. We will win if we stay as one.”/>
<2><Protester>Over the past week, Occupy Nashville has made itself at home on Legislative Plaza. /></><Useless>Newer and lower-key than its Wall Street counterparts,/> <Camp>the group provides its members with /><Camp>food/><Camp>, shelter, and medical and legal assistance as they camp out on the hard granite of one of Nashville’s most public places./>
The Southern Festival of Books obligingly carved out a space for the occupation this weekend. Sleeping bags and tables of food are tucked away behind the festival’s tents and performance spaces.
<Strategy>“We want to keep it civil, keep it peaceful, keep it mature,”/> said protester Phillip Schlicher, standing next to a table of donated food and <Camp>a sign outlining the rules for participating in the protest: Throw away your trash and recycle your recyclables; respect others who use the plaza; speak for yourself, not the group./>
<Camp>Occupy Nashville is a leaderless organization, with decisions made by group consensus />— and anyone who wants to take part can come down and participate in the <Camp>daily assemblies, held at 1 p.m. on weekends in the plaza and 7 on weeknights./>
<Opinionor>Jacob Kaset, a Nashville landscaper, comes down to the protest every night after work. It reminds him of the Vietnam protest era./>
<Opinionor>“I have no idea where this (movement) is going, but we can’t keep going the way we are,” he said. “Where people are working a job and a half and they still can’t make ends meet.”/>
