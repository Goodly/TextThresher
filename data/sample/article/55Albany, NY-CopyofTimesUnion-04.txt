<5><Strategy>"We all agree we're not on the same page,"/></><Camp>said Mark Mishler, a lawyer for Occupy Albany/><2><Government> who has sat in on the group's meetings with the city./></><Info> "Our expectation is that people will be staying in Academy Park past Dec. 22."/>
City officials would not speculate Wednesday on what would happen if protesters still had their tents staked in the park come the first day of winter, but Mishler said <6><Strategy>the city has indicated it has no intention of forcibly removing the demonstrators./></>
<Useless>"It's hard to imagine any municipal official looking at Oakland, Philadelphia, or Los Angeles and thinking that makes any sense at all," Mishler said, referring to cities that have seen efforts by police to remove protesters turn turbulent./> "How can you look at that and think that makes sense? <5><Strategy>My impression is the city is looking at those things and they know it's wrong, dangerous, and completely unnecessary."/></>
Assistant Corporation Counsel Jeffery Jamison, who also serves as the city's director of building and codes, suggested any dispute over Occupy Albany's right to stay in the park 24 hours a day after Dec. 22 — the group will be free to protest on city land during the day — may end up in court. "That option is always there for either party," he said.
<2><Legal_Action>With the backing of Albany County District Attorney/></><2><Legal_Action> David Soares/></><2><Legal_Action>, the protesters were successful in their first round of court appearances last month. That's when Soares' office, against the desire of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, moved to dismiss all charges of trespassing and disorderly conduct/></> against <ToBe>more than 100 protesters arrested over eight nights by/><ToBe> State Police/><ToBe> for crossing into the adjacent state-owned Lafayette Park after its 11 p.m. curfew. /><Government>[11 p.m. curfew.]/>
Mishler said that <2><Strategy>peaceful cooperation between both sides is a direct result of factors that brought Soares and Albany Police Chief/></><2><Strategy> Steve Krokoff/></><2><Strategy> into office./></> <Useless>Soares was ushered into office in 2004 thanks in part to a tremendous amount of grassroots support; Krokoff was chosen as chief with the backing of the/><Useless> Albany Common Council/>.
"With past administrations, I do not think things may have played out for us the way they did," <Camp>Mishler said./> "<5><Strategy>There's a certain level of commitment to the community from (Soares and Krokoff) that is making the success of Occupy Albany unique."/></>
<3><Strategy>Occupy Albany members, however, maintain their movement will not be as effective if/></> <3><Strategy>they do not have a 24-hour presence./></> The group said they and Occupy movements around the state had a direct influence on a bipartisan tax plan unveiled Tuesday that cuts taxes for those earning between $40,000 and $300,000. "We would like to take a lot of credit for that," said Johanson.
<Camp>At the behest of the city, the protesters scaled down their encampment to meet the permit requirements. Among other regulations of the permit, Occupy Albany is now limited to 30 tents, cannot have open flames or cooking equipment and is limited to two heaters and one generator that must be attended to at all times, though the encampment had none of the latter items at the park Wednesday afternoon./><Government> [Among other regulations of the permit, Occupy Albany is now limited to 30 tents, cannot have open flames or cooking equipment and is limited to two heaters and one generator that must be attended to at all times, though the encampment had none of the latter items at the park Wednesday afternoon.] /><3><Legal_Action>[Among other regulations of the permit, Occupy Albany is now limited to 30 tents, cannot have open flames or cooking equipment and is limited to two heaters and one generator that must be attended to at all times, though the encampment had none of the latter items at the park Wednesday afternoon.]/></>
