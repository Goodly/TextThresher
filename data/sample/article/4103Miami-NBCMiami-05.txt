<Camp>Occupy Miami protesters set up about 20 tents in the downtown area,/> and on Sunday they said that they plan to stay there throughout the week.
<Camp>Members of the group said they set up in front of the Government Center at 111 NW 1st St. because it's near a large transportation hub and generates a lot of foot traffic. Police said that the protestors are unofficially allowed to stay at that location./>
"I slept there last night with,<Camp> I counted, about 100 fellow occupiers,"/> said Occupy Miami member Misael Soto.
"To me, literally occupying is the greatest display of solidarity for the cause I can show ," Soto said as to why he camped out Saturday night. "<Opinionor>It's what the movement is all about. Protesting 24/7, taking back our government and economy."/>
Other members of Occupy Miami expressed their concerns, and explained why they plan to keep protesting.
<Opinionor>"I'm upset about money and politics, it's a big one,/>" said group member Seth Crouser. <Opinionor>"I'm  personally upset about the financial collapse and how that happened and how there's been no culpability."/>
"What we're doing right now is kind of an experience with democracy," Occupy Miami member Mike Park said. "And it's giving us an idea of what can be done with masses."
<Protester>The group had gathered on Saturday, as hundreds of protestors gathered along Biscayne Boulevard,/> <Opinionor>chanting and holding up signs showing their frustration and anger at corporate America, the federal government and the banking system./>
<Protester>They marched several blocks to Government Center where they continued their demonstration. /><2><Protester>[Government Center where they continued their demonstration.]/></><Protester> Drivers honked to show their support as protestors stood outside./>
People chanted and <Opinionor>held up signs. One sign read: "Banks Were Bailed Out You Were Sold Out" and another read "Healthcare Not Warfare." />Meanwhile, the Herald reported that police said the <Protester>number of protestors had been more than 1,000./>
People continued discussing the protest on <Camp>Occupy Miami's Facebook page/> throughout the weekend. <Useless>Protestors also gathered in Fort Lauderdale on Sunday in the Bubier park area to show their continued support of the Occupy movement./>
<Useless>"Hey everyone!" /><Useless>Occupy Fort Lauderdale posted/><Useless> on their Facebook page. "It's a beautiful day to make our presence known in FTL! Come on down to the Bubier park area and help us make it known that we aren't going anywhere."/>
<Useless>Meanwhile, in Chicago, the early morning arrests of 175 members of a group demonstrating against corporate greed signified a new phase of civil disobedience for the city's wing of the movement, organizers said Sunday./>
<Useless>The arrests came after hundreds of members of Occupy Chicago refused to take down tents and leave Grant Park near the city's lakefront when it closed at 11 p.m. Saturday. Organizers did not seek a permit to be in the park after hours, saying they stayed because they need a home base for the growing movement./>
<Useless>On Saturday, Occupy protestors gathered all over the world. Violence broke out in Rome, where police fired tear gas and water cannons at some protestors who broke away from the main demonstration, smashing shop and bank windows, torching cars and hurtling bottles. Dozens were injured. And tens of thousands marched in cities across Europe, as the protests that began in New York linked up with long-running demonstration against government cost-cutting and failed financial policies in Europe. Protestors also turned out in Australia and Asia./>
<Useless>The Occupy Wall Street demonstration started out small last month, with less than a dozen college students spending days and nights in Zucotti Park, a private plaza off Broadway. It has grown significantly, however, both in New York City and elsewhere as people in other communities display their solidarity in similar protests./>
