The Occupy Wall Street movement spread to<Protester> Cleveland Wednesday with six people marching from Johnston Park to the Bradley County Courthouse Plaza where they held signs and waved to passing motorists./>
<Opinionor>“We are everywhere and we are everyone,” said Howard Hayes, of Benton. “We are here in support of Occupy Wall Street in New York City to make the people’s voice heard. Many of us feel the people’s voice is no longer being heard.”/>
<Opinionor>Hayes alleged the Occupy movement focused on Wall Street because bankers and corporations have purchased politicians and all the rights and privileges of a human being with none of the responsibilities./>
Beth Foster, of Cleveland, said a decision on how visible the local protest will be depends on conclusions made by a general assembly of the participants. The assembly is designed so there is no hierarchy or leadership and everyone’s voice is heard.
The goal, she said, is to get money out of politics.
<Opinionor>“We want to own our government again,” she said. “The American people no longer own the government.”/>
Foster said they might decide to occupy a space in Cleveland at some point in the future, <Camp>but most of the locals are working with Occupy Chattanooga. />
“We may be doing the actual occupation with them, but what we want people to know is there is a presence in Cleveland,” she said.
Foster said Occupy has been compared to the tea party movement that sprang up prior to the last presidential election. The difference is that Occupy is not a political party. It is neither left nor right, Democrat nor Republican.
<Opinionor>“Some of the political action committees affiliated with the Democratic Party have tried to move in on Occupy. The Democrats are as much a part of the problem as the Republicans. This is a nonpartisan movement,” she said./>
Hayes said they are a very loosely formed, <Camp>leaderless organization/><Opinionor> protesting against corporate greed and corruption. />
<Opinionor>“We support freedom, equality, justice and liberty,” he said. “We are being oppressed. There have been police atrocities across the country and we should absolutely have the freedom to assemble as we please, when we please in public areas.”/>
Foster said a desired outcome has not been established.
“There is not necessarily an end that has been established yet,” she said. “We are going through a dialoguing process to get to that end.”
Hayes has been participating in Occupy Chattanooga and planned to return to <Useless>Chattanooga later in the evening to stay overnight on the lawn at City Hall. />
<Opinionor>“We are not going anywhere. We have the First Amendment right to assemble and it does not limit us to any time schedule or city ordinance,” he said. “It is our constitutional right to assemble in nonviolent protest.”/>
<Useless>Hayes believes refusal of two Nashville magistrates to uphold the arrests of 29 protesters on Oct. 29, and 26 people on Oct. 30, based on a curfew put in place on Oct. 28, sets a legal precedent./>
<Useless>The Cleveland protesters are part of the Occupy movement, which began in lower Manhattan as Occupy Wall Street to decry corporate influence in government and wealth inequality. It has spread to cities large and small across the country and around the world./>
Breann Murray Tolley and her husband own Clover Wreath Farm where they grow organic products in Cleveland.<Opinionor> She is concerned about corruption and food security./>
<Opinionor>“A substantial amount of the federal budget goes to large corporate farms that do not have our health or our environment (in mind). I would really like to see the money given to small, sustainable farms so we can keep food more local and more sustainable,” she said. />
Chad Jones, a sophomore at Cleveland State Community College, left the Navy only to find his military education and practical experience were disregarded, “because I didn’t have a piece of paper.”
Matthew Deniston, of Cleveland, is a member of the Georgia National Guard who has deployed twice each to Iraq and Afghanistan.<Opinionor> He is concerned about waste and fraud in the military./>
<Useless>According to the Occupy Wall Street website, it is “a resistance movement with people of many colors, genders and political persuasions. The one thing we all have in common is that We Are The 99 percent that will no longer tolerate the greed and corruption of the 1 percent. We are using the revolutionary Arab Spring tactic to achieve our ends and encourage the use of nonviolence to maximize the safety of all participants.”/>
<Protester>who marched around the Bradley County Courthouse Sunday afternoon protesting the “Equal Access to Public Property Act of 2012” />authored by State Rep. Eric Watson, R-Cleveland representing the 22nd Legislative District. <Opinionor>Members of the Occupy Movement say the bill makes homelessness a crime. Csapo said hundreds of thousands of working class families have been thrown out of their homes. He charged the foreclosure policies in the United States are the extraction of wealth from the working class. There is not a jump in homeless so much as there is a jump in “un-homed” people, he explained. There are more empty houses than there are homeless families,/> he said.
