on the boulevard
<Useless>Check the calendar: 11-11-11. You have aces six places on the Boulevard today./>
<Useless>10 DOWN: Who knows how many more to go in the federal investigation into fraud and corruption inside local homeowners associations?/>
<Useless>On Thursday, former homeowners association official Denise Keser pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud in connection with the investigation at the Chateau Nouveau condominium complex. />
<Useless>Earlier this week, Daniel Solomon added his name to the same list. A former Vistana condominium complex homeowners association board member, Solomon admitted committing felonies in order to further a conspiracy that generated a lawsuit and directed many millions in settlement fees to construction defect contractors and attorneys./>
<Useless>Solomon was a minor player with a front-row seat to the shenanigans that went on at his homeowners association. He pleaded guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud./>
<Useless>If the setup at Vistana was among the most brazen, it wasn't unique. In all, a dozen homeowners associations are said to be under investigation./>
<Useless>Although not all the players benefited much from the conspiracy, the end result was staggering at Vistana: a $19 million settlement that flowed toward attorneys and Silver Lining Construction contractor Leon Benzer./>
<Useless>Although they've not yet been charged, Benzer and construction defect litigator Nancy Quon are considered key targets in the investigation./>
<Useless>I'm taking bets that Benzer cuts a deal with the government./>
<Useless>For weeks, sources close to the investigation have said the pressure on Benzer to cooperate has continued to increase./>
<Useless>His name has also been mentioned in connection with a bank loan fraud investigation that is linked to the operation of the Courthouse Cafe downtown, which already has netted the guilty plea and cooperation of local attorney David Amesbury./>
<Useless>Solomon, who admitted being a "straw purchaser" and joining the board to further the conspiracy, isn't the biggest player in the case./>
<Useless>But his guilty plea nails one more plank into the foundation of the case being brought by the Department of Justice Criminal Division's Fraud Section./>
<Useless>It's being investigated by the FBI, IRS Criminal Investigation and Metro./>
OCCUPY LV INTRIGUE: A<Camp>nd all this time I thought the well-meaning souls inside the Occupy Las Vegas movement were all in this together. Not according to Occupy Las Vegas activist Gina Sully, who describes a rift between the group and a charity called Opportunities Las Vegas over control of the off-Strip encampment. />I thought they were one sprawling, happy family living in a Free Speech zone that occupiers are calling "Area 99."
Can't they all just get along?
<Useless>MILITARY PRESENCE: Wayne Carrington of Living Faith Assembly knows a blessing when he sees one. Retired Metro cop Carrington and his wife, Beverly, help coordinate the local church's food pantry each week. The pantry, supplied by Three Square Food Bank, feeds hundreds of needy locals./>
<Useless>What has impressed Carrington lately is the increase in volunteers from the Nellis and Creech Air Force bases. Military personnel with a full slate of responsibilities are taking time out to help feed poor and working-class families hit hard by the recession./>
<Useless>It's a reminder that a little extra effort can go a long way in tough times./>
<Useless>"Tell me that's not a blessing," Carrington says./>
<Useless>ON THE BOULEVARD: At the recent UNLV-Boise State football game at Sam Boyd Stadium, former College of Southern Nevada construction official William "Bob" Gilbert was welcomed in the President's Box as a guest of his friend and ally, University Regent Mark Alden. Gilbert was convicted of property theft charges at trial, but has maintained his innocence. He has a fierce defender in Alden, who was hired to conduct the forensic examination of Gilbert's finances on behalf of the defense in the case, which is now under appeal./>
<Useless>"He's innocent," Alden said this week. "If anything, they owe him money."/>
