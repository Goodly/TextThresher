Lawyers play careful role in Occupy movements: As protests continue around the Carolinas, attorneys act as mediators and educators - but not legal advisers

Lawyers are playing integral roles in the burgeoning Occupy movements around the Carolinas, and their participation is becoming even more important as tensions intensify between government officials and protesters.
<Useless>In Raleigh, a young lawyer is in the midst of an uphill policy battle with state officials who refuse to let protesters hold long-term demonstrations on the capitol grounds. A law school professor in Greensboro trains people to act as legal witnesses for the local occupiers just in case they have police trouble./><Camp> In Charleston, a seasoned attorney camps with protesters and helps them build a rapport with city representatives./>
<Useless>"They've kind of been our unofficial legal lifelines in giving us the advice and support we need," said Stacie J. Borrello, a freelance writer and editor who helped organize Occupy Raleigh. "It's given us a sense of security just to know that they were there for us. "/>
Lawyers who give legal education and other forms of support to the occupiers, a group that is committed to civil disobedience, tiptoe along a thin ethical line. <Useless>When 31-year-old attorney Nicholas C. Woomer-Deters joined up with Occupy Raleigh, he went around telling protesters that he was a lawyer, but not their lawyer./>
<Useless>"I had to make that abundantly clear - to the point that it may have annoyed some of them," said Woomer-Deters. He works at N.C. Prisoner Legal Services and is a member of the National Lawyers Guild, which has represented protesters throughout the country./>
<Useless>Woomer-Deters has been trying to convince the N.C. Department of Administration to give the occupiers permission to demonstrate for more than four hours at a time on the capitol grounds in downtown Raleigh. So far, his efforts have been unsuccessful./>
<Useless>He was with the protesters on Oct. 15, when police arrested 20 of them for trying to demonstrate on the capitol grounds overnight. Before police began rounding up the protesters, Woomer-Deters said he warned everyone that they would likely be arrested if they refused to leave. But he avoided giving anyone specific legal direction./>
<Useless>"I would never say that you should do this and you shouldn't do that," he said. "I'm supportive of civil disobedience in the absolute most general sense. ... Although I think civil disobedience under certain circumstances is a very appropriate reaction, I don't think it's appropriate for me to be advocating certain acts of civil disobedience. "/>
<Useless>Jason E. Huber, an assistant professor of civil rights and public policy at the Charlotte School of Law, agreed that an attorney usually crosses that ethical line when encouraging a person to break the law./>
<Useless>But Huber went on to note a narrow First Amendment exception that paves the way for a lawyer to advise someone to violate a law that is blatantly unconstitutional./>
<Useless>"If an ordinance was passed saying that Occupy Charlotte can no longer express its public rights," he said, "a lawyer could say, 'Go ahead and march so we can challenge that in court. '"/>
<Useless>Attorneys who are arrested for acts of peaceful civil disobedience (Lawyers Weekly was not aware of that happening in the Carolinas) would not necessarily face disbarment, Huber said. He cites the Rules of Professional Conduct, which define misconduct, in part, as "a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects. "/>
<Useless>"If it is nonviolent civil disobedience, the lawyer's actions as an individual would not run afoul of that provision," Huber said. "Protesting in a nonviolent way is different than robbing a bank. "/>
<Useless>Christopher Inglese, a recent graduate of the Charleston School of Law, joined the Occupy movement because he's concerned about the relationship between big corporations and politics. As a soon-to-be-licensed attorney, he said he didn't want to take any professional risks by making missteps during the protests./>
<Useless>"I certainly recognize my professional obligation to recommend and engage in only lawful conduct," he said. "That doesn't mean I can't go out and make some noise and beat on a drum and chant some chants, as long as it's within the parameters of city regulation. "/>
<Useless>'Atticus Finch in their little town'/>
<Useless>In his 68 years, Greensboro lawyer P. Lewis Pitts Jr. has been arrested six times for civil disobedience. His first run-in with the law was in 1978, when he was protesting "environmental injustice" issues involving nuclear power./>
<Useless>Most people outside the bar see lawyers as suited-up members of the wealthy 1 percent, the exact demographic that the Occupy movement's self-styled 99 percenters are railing against, Pitts said./>
<Useless>"There are a lot of lawyers who are torn by this, the desire to do well," he said. "They get caught up in the business of doing law rather than the profession. It's supposed to be about service, not profit. "/>
<Useless>Of course, not all lawyers are doing the backstroke through piles of cash. But Pitts feels that too many members of the bar are watching the occupiers from a safe distance, fearful that getting involved could hurt them professionally./>
<Useless>"I think the emphasis should be the other way," he said. "The profession and bar has been too chilled and has stayed out of these issues. Rather than worrying about restraining and chilling ourselves, we should be focused on studying the morals and ethics that are at the core of what allows us to be a self-regulating bar. "/>
<Legal_Action>In Charleston, lawyer William "Jack" Hamilton III helped two young occupiers get a meeting with important representatives from virtually every department in the city so they could talk about a permit to camp and demonstrate at Brittlebank Park /><Info>[a permit to camp and demonstrate at Brittlebank Park]/>.
"There were about a dozen people around this table, men and women in their uniforms with their patches and symbols of authority," Hamilton said. "It's safe to say that they were 'The Man. '"
But <Government>by the end of the discussion, city officials passed around a permit and each of them signed off on it. />Then they handed it back to the two young protesters. <Info>Occupy Charleston had gotten the OK. Their protest would be legal./>
"That's what a lawyer gets to do on his best day," Hamilton said.
<Camp>The occupiers set up a tent and mattress for Hamilton, a member of the South Carolina bar since 1985, and he camped with them./>
"They went out of their way to get me to do that," he said. "I think that I got to be the Atticus Finch in their little town."
Informing a movement
<Useless>Erik Fink, an associate professor at Elon University School of Law in Greensboro, agreed that an attorney's law license should not be jeopardized by his or her participation in peaceful civil disobedience./>
<Useless>"Does that reflect badly on your character?" he said. "Not necessarily. "/>
<Useless>Fink teaches a course on professional responsibility but is not licensed to practice law in North Carolina. He frequently visits with members of Occupy Greensboro, who are camping at the old YWCA property downtown, and has trained legal observers to help watch over the protesters./>
<Useless>"Given what's happened in other cities with arrests," Fink said, "we wanted to make sure everything went smoothly. "/>
<Useless>As the Occupy movement grows and city officials lose patience, chaotic scenes between police and protesters are becoming more common - as happened in Atlanta and Oakland, California, last week. When mass arrests occur, legal observers can provide an adequate defense for protesters, especially when the only other witnesses are fellow demonstrators and police./>
<Useless>"One thing we tell our observers is 'You're not chanting. You're not wearing the T-shirts. You're there to be a friendly observer,'" said Woomer-Deters, who has overseen legal observers and acted as an observer at Occupy Raleigh./>
<Useless>"Sometimes people say some great stuff at these demonstrations," he added. "You want to cheer sometimes. Sometimes I have to catch myself. That's part of your role as a legal observer -- to not get involved. "/>
<Useless>Chapel Hill attorney Peter H. Gilbert, a community inclusion fellow at UNC's Center for Civil Rights, led a "know-your-rights" training session for his local occupiers. He talked about the history of civil disobedience, told protesters what to expect if they were arrested and what their rights were when talking with police./>
<Useless>"We're providing information in a public way," Gilbert said, "but it's not specific legal advice that's tailored to their situation. "/>
<Useless>He'll be teaching an Occupy-inspired continuing legal education course Dec. 1 at UNC Chapel Hill, exploring the ethical implications of representing leaderless community groups.   He said the "ethical rules are insufficient at this point to guide you along that path, but there are some best practice models. "/>
<Useless>Before entering into an attorney-client relationship with an Occupy-like group, a lawyer should know exactly how the group makes decisions and have the ability to communicate freely with all of its members, Gilbert said. That means the attorney needs to know who is in the group and who isn't, which can be difficult, if not impossible, in an Occupy protest./>
<Useless>"It's deliberately leaderless," he said. "In a case like this, it can be very unclear who the client is. "/>
<Useless>That issue may be murky, but attorneys who are participating in the protests should avoid representing fellow occupiers who are arrested. Because they may be witnesses and could have been involved in a crime themselves, there is a huge potential for conflict, said Fink, the law professor in Greensboro./>
<Useless>"If you're taking part in this activity you may be a witness," he said, "and it's probably not going to be a good idea to agree to represent some of these people. "/>
