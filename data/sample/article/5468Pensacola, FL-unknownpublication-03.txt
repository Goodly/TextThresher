Occupy Mobile Protestors Camp Out
(MOBILE, Ala.) - Protestors with the Occupy Mobile movement have set up camp at Spanish Plaza and plan to stick around for awhile.
They've protested every Saturday, now they are making a bigger statement.
"We plan to stay out here for the long haul," said Laci Gagliano. She first heard about the movement on the internet, and now has set up camp. "We would like to prove that we are here, we have a voice and we'll be heard."
The Occupy Mobile group emphasizes they are peacefully protesting.
Saturday will be the first night they spend in Spanish Plaza.
As for when they plan to leave, Tyler Henderson says it could be awhile.
"We just made a countdown schedule, and it looks like it goes all the way to this time 2012."
