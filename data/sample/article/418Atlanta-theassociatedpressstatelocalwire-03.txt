<Useless>"As mayor, I am proud of the city of Atlanta's heritage as the birthplace of the civil rights movement," Reed said in a statement released by his office./> <Strategy>"At the same time, I am committed to protecting the public and ensuring that the laws of the city are respected. I will not allow public safety to be jeopardized in any way by the protesters. /><2><Strategy>So far, all of their actions have been peaceful and nonviolent."/></>
The situation has created a quandary for city officials and police who have asked them to leave.<Government> The city has not enforced the ordinance, allowing the protesters to remain./>
Occupy Atlanta spokesman <3><Strategy>Tim Franzen said he was happy to hear of the executive order, but that they would not be deterred and plan to hold their ground./></>
"We're in a position right now where we feel like either way, we're doing what we need to do," Franzen told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. "When we get evicted, there will be people who will put their bodies on the line nonviolently and go to jail."

About 50 protesters in Boston were arrested Monday night when they ignored warnings to move from a downtown greenway near where they have been camped out for more than a week, according to police. Several hundred protesters were arrested in New York more than a week ago after police said they ignored warnings to stay in place./>
<2><Government>The park closes to the public at 11 p.m. under city law. The code is intended to keep homeless people from sleeping in parks, but has ensnared the otherwise peaceful protesters./></>
