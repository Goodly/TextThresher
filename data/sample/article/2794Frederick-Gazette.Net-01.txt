<Opinionor>Inspired by the American Dream Movement and protest rallies that have been going on in cities across the country, protesters urged politicians to put stop the war, end budget cuts and invest money to address the job crisis in order to save the American middle class./>
And despite <Camp>the rainy weather, /><Opinionor>people of all ages held up signs, sang Woody Guthrie’s “This Land is Your Land” and encouraged drivers to honk in support of their message./>
<Opinionor>“I am here to support the American Dream Movement,” said Valerie Hartman, a Frederick resident and a teacher, />who has already participated in a similar rally in Washington, D.C. Hartman’s children, on the other hand, marched in the Occupy Wall Street rally in New York.
<Opinionor>“There was no way I was going to miss the one in Frederick,” said Hartman who carried a sign stating “Capitalism with Compassion.”/>

<Opinionor>“I don’t want anarchy and I don’t want communism,” she added. “I want capitalism with compassion.”/>
The American Dream Movement endorses 10 steps to revive the American Dream. Among other steps, the movement urges politicians to stop the war, invest in American infrastructure, outlaw corporate tax breaks and invest in public education and creating 21st century energy jobs.
<Opinionor>“I can’t imagine any American being against that,” Hartman said./>
<Opinionor>Frederick resident Art Silverman agreed and said he took his 8-year-old son Charlie out of school just so he could participate in the protest./>
<Opinionor>“I took him out of school for a lesson in democracy,” Silverman said./>
<Opinionor>“We want to let people know that the Tea Party doesn’t have a monopoly on patriotism in Frederick,” he added./>
The Frederick protest was one of more than 300 events taking place around the country as part of American Dream Movement’s “Jobs Not Cuts” week of action, which started on Monday.
<Opinionor>“We are a huge movement,” said Jeannette Bartelt, a 64-year-old Frederick resident and /><Camp>the Frederick MoveOn coordinator who organized the Frederick rally./>

<Opinionor>Though the rally was focused on national issues, Bartelt said she hopes it would be an opportunity to address politicians — such as U.S. Rep. Roscoe G. Bartlett (R - Dist. 6) of Buckeystown to Frederick Board of County Commissioners President Blaine R. Young (R) — and confront them about cutting jobs./>
<Strategy>Bartelt said she was very pleased with the turnout at the event on Wednesday, especially because the weather was bad and it took place in the middle of the work week./>
<Opinionor>“People are hurting,” she said. “This is really a people’s movement.”/>
<Opinionor>Susan Beam, another Frederick resident who joined the protest agreed with that. Beam, who is self-employed and used to paint homes, said the bad economy has deprived her of the opportunity to take care of herself. So she said she wants to see politicians stop investing in the war and put money into job creation inside the U.S./>
<Opinionor>“I don’t want welfare, I just want a job,” she said. “I want to support myself.”/>
