<Camp>Occupy Everett is organizing online at Facebook and in person at Snohomish County Courthouse/>
<Camp>Another meeting of the General Assembly of Occupy Everett will be held at the Flag Plaza of the Snohomish County Courthouse at 7pm tonight. Last night a group of around 42 people /><Camp>started forming working groups and organizing /><Camp>to begin the occupation of the Snohomish County Administration Plaza./><Opinionor> Michael Lapointe, whose name is on the permit application, tells me the group is still playing it by ear when it comes to setting up the occupation, “We’re all new to this and are learning as we go.” said Lapointe./> <Strategy>Dealing with Snohomish County was a pleasant suprise, Lapointe added. “Deputy Executive Gary Haakenson was very cordial, welcoming, it’s the way it should be when citizens who have a right to protest, deal with the government.”


/><Police>I also talked with Snohomish County Sheriff John Lovick and Support Services Chief Kevin Prentiss this morning. Prentiss told me they don’t expect to incurr any extra overtime costs in monitoring the security of the Administration and Courthouse complex and will use deputies on regular shifts to provide coverage. “It’s part of our regular duties to provide for the safety and security of all people who use the county complex,” Prentiss said. “We do it every day for demonstrators and customers alike.”/>


<Camp>The Occupy Everett general assembly meetings will be held weekday evenings at 7pm and in weekends at 12noon./>
