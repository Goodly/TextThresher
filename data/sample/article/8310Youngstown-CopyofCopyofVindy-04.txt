<2><Police>An officer gave the group a five-minute warning that the items would be confiscated, Walker said./></>
<Police>The Occupy members offered no resistance, and the police and firefighters were respectful saying they were only doing their jobs, Walker said./>
Occupy Youngstown has no plans to leave the location, said Thomas Sabatini, a member.
Members will meet later today to decide whether to put up another tent and replace the confiscated items, he said.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if this continues again and again” Sabatini said. “We have the right to remain in a public space and express public opinion.”
<Police>Police Chief Rod Foley had ordered the group to remove the tent, barrel and other items by midnight Thursday, citing city-ordinance violations. /><Government>[Police Chief Rod Foley had ordered the group to remove the tent, barrel and other items by midnight Thursday, citing city-ordinance violations.] /><Camp>[Police Chief Rod Foley had ordered the group to remove the tent, barrel and other items by midnight Thursday, citing city-ordinance violations.]/>
