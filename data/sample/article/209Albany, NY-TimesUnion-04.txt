<Legal_Action>"It's a result of the meetings between the Occupy Albany folks and the city to make sure we're all on the same page, particularly for issues of health and safety,"/> said Bob Van Amburgh, an aide to Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings.
<Legal_Action>The three-page document was delivered to/><Legal_Action> Mark Mishler/><Legal_Action>, an attorney aligned with the demonstrators, Friday evening by/><Legal_Action> Stephen Rehfuss/><Legal_Action>, an attorney who has often represented the city in civil rights matters./>
<Legal_Action>The memo would last one week,/> <Info>with representatives from both sides reconvening two days before its expiration./> <Government>It limits the encampment to three portable toilets, two propane heaters and one generator. It would forbid clotheslines between the park's trees and open flames for cooking, including "Coleman-style" camp stoves./>
<Government>"No permanent or semipermanent structures or signs shall be maintained on the premises. No tents larger than those tents presently on the premises are allowed," the memo says. It also would limit the encampment to 30 tents./> <Camp>[It limits the encampment to three portable toilets, two propane heaters and one generator.

<Legal_Action>The memo would also release the city from liability for injuries within the encampment./>
Most of the its provisions are tailored to the protest, <Useless>an offshoot of Manhattan's/><Useless> Occupy Wall Street/><Useless> raising concerns about economic inequality and corporate power, in its current form./> While some demonstrators have talked of the need to erect more permanent shelter -- perhaps a yurt with a woodstove -- Occupy Albany has made no concrete moves to do so.
<Legal_Action>Mishler and eight other protesters met Tuesday with public safety officials in City Hall to discuss concerns around the protests, />and <Government>Albany Fire Chief/><Government> Robert Forrezzi/><Government> led an inspection of the encampment Wednesday./>
While <Government>Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings at first said he would enforce an 11 p.m. curfew in the park -- after discussions with top aides to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who said they would enforce a similar curfew in adjacent Lafayette Park />-- <Legal_Action>city police officials and Albany County District Attorney/><Legal_Action> David Soares/><Legal_Action> resisted./>
The result has been <Strategy>detente between the occupation and the city's government,/> i<Useless>n contrast to cities like Rochester, where police are arresting demonstrators almost nightly for violating park curfews./>
<Strategy>But the memo may be a step too far toward normalization, several demonstrators said Sunday evening/>. Mishler presented the document to over three dozen demonstrators for discussion, many of whom wondered if Occupy Albany could ever sign it.
"What would that signature even mean?" Mishler asked, noting the fluid nature of the protest.
While no formal action can be taken before the <Camp>encampment's nightly general assembly Monday night,/> the <Camp>three dozen demonstrators agreed to a five-part proposal that including not signing the document. /><Legal_Action>[three dozen demonstrators agreed to a five-part proposal that including not signing the document.]/>
<Legal_Action>The proposed response would also reiterate thanks to the City for respecting and enforcing protections of First Amendment rights, declare understanding for the city's need to regulate health and safety and reiterate its own policies and actions./>
<Legal_Action>They also agreed to invite city officials to their nightly general assemblies /><Camp>[nightly general assemblies]/><Legal_Action> and reiterate their continued commitment to dialogue. /><Strategy>[continued commitment to dialogue.]/>
It's unclear what the city's next move will be. Many demonstrators considered the proposed MOU to be an unnecessary retreat on their part, given the city's complete tolerance to date.
What will the Jennings administration do if it is rejected, as proposed?
"That's a good question," Van Amburgh said.
