The Ohio Department of Natural Resources has a permit request for construction of what's called a brine injection <Protester>well off Masury Road near Interstate 80 in Hubbard Township./>
<Protester>That's where Occupy Youngstown members staged a protest with their message: There's too many unknowns for the project to happen./>
"The rights of the people have just gone away. We have no say," said Occupy Youngstown member John Williams.
<Strategy>Williams and a group of protestors held signs against fracking and an injection well that could soon be located on Masury Road off Route 62. D & L Energy would drill the well./>
"These chemicals never go away. Once those toxins are in our ground, they're here forever," Williams said.
The brine well, thousands of feet deep, is where a company would dispose of fluids from the oil and natural gas drilling process. ODNR said there's nearly 150,000 of these types of wells in the United States.
Williams said he feels enough isn't known about fracking and the fluids that eventually have to be disposed. For him, current regulations aren't tough enough.
"Fracking and the gas companies have had the laws changed since 2005 to benefit themselves," Williams said.
"Our government officials aren't listening to us. They're out for the money, and that's a big concern for me," said Chris Khuprakob of Occupy Youngstown.
Khumprakob was not at last week's public meeting where an ODNR representative shared information and answered questions, but she stands firm that there's not been enough long-term information gathered and analyzed.
"I think we need to study it more before we start fracking all over Ohio," she said.
Although the group wants the entire process banned, they realize the likeliness of that happening is slim.
"The more people that stand against this the better the chances we have of banning it," Williams said.
The township has requested a moratorium on the construction of the well, but there is no word on any action yet. As for the permit request, it's still in the hands of ODNR.
Williams said his opposition to fracking doesn't mean he's not for bringing new jobs to the region.
"We'd like to replace it with clean industry," Williams said.
