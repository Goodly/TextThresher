Kentuckians are getting involved in a movement that's sweeping across the nation.<Useless> It all started last month when a group of protestors began camping out in New York to protest Wall Street and what they consider corporate greed. Since then they've been joined by folks in at least 25 cities including Lexington./>
<Useless>What began as the Occupy Wall Street movement in September has found its way across America/>.<Opinionor> "This is fairly radical for a place like Lexington," David Madden said./>
For more than a week Madden and a growing group of protestors have occupied the <Camp>sidewalks outside Chase Tower in downtown Lexington/><Opinionor> hoping to promote awareness of economic disparity they attribute to corporate greed. "Now a bachelor's degree and a master's degree is not worth what a high /><Opinionor>school/><Opinionor> diploma was worth forty years ago," Madden said./>
<Opinionor>Madden credits high unemployment rates for the growth of the Occupy movement, and he says even many who have jobs are sympathetic to the cause. "I have a /><Opinionor>Bachelor's degree/><Opinionor>, and I'm working for barely above minimum wage," Madden said./>
<Opinionor>Phillip Geurtz says he brought his four-year-old daughter, Avery, to the protest to teach her about the democratic process. "If things don't change, if society doesn't change, then I don't know where I'm going to be," Geurtz said, "I won't be able to find /><Opinionor>a job/><Opinionor>, and that directly affects her."/>
<Opinionor>"The chances of getting a job when I graduate are so low," UK sophomore Sammy Meador said./><Opinionor>College students/><Opinionor> have filled the ranks with some staying overnight to maintain a 24-hour presence. "There isn't one thing that we're protesting. There is a slew of grievances," Meador explained, "The reason it may seem unfocused is because it's such a broad issue, and the things we're calling for are kind of structural changes."/>
<Opinionor>"People just feel like they have been pushed," Madden said, "their backs are to the wall, and they have no choice at this point but to push back."/>
Many of the Occupy Wall Street protesters admit they've yet to fully develop their goals. Members of Occupy Lexington say they expect to publish their list of specific demands in the coming days
