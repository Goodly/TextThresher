<Strategy>San Francisco cops have shown "tremendous restraint"/> in <ToBe>their recent scuffles with Occupy SF protesters,/> <Police>police Chief Greg Suhr declared Wednesday night./>
<Police>During a Police Commission meeting, Suhr defended/> <2><Police>the dozens of arrests made early Wednesday during and after the 1 a.m. raid on the Justin Herman Plaza encampment./></>
<2><Police>More than 100 officers carried out the raid on the approximately 150 protesters, Officer Albie Esparza said./></> <Protester>Later in the day, protesters attempted to reclaim the plaza and had a three-hour standoff with cops./>
<Protester>"We don’t have any reports, at least at this time, of any of the Occupy people being injured,"/> the police chief told commissioners at the Wednesday night meeting.
<Protester>Some protesters complained of injuries, but it wasn’t clear whether any were serious. /><Strategy>Most/>
<Strategy>expressed anger/> <2><Police>that cops gave them only five minutes to pack up their belongings and leave the plaza./></> <Strategy>Suhr took issue with that sentiment./>
<2><Police>"They were told they had five minutes, but per the computer-assisted dispatch log, it was actually close to 18 minutes that folks had to gather their belongings,"/></> Suhr said, adding that <3><Police>campers were actually given two months of warning to vacate./></>
<2><Police>Seventy-nine of the protesters left the plaza peacefully during the raid, with four resisting arrest but not causing assault or injury, Suhr said. Others were more combative, he said./></>
<2><Police>"There were three felony assaults on the officers," Suhr said. "One demonstrator threw a bottle, another demonstrator threw a garbage can that injured an officer, and another demonstrator threw a metal chair that struck an officer in the face of his helmet, breaking his face shield."/></>
<2><Police>The suspect accused of hurling the metal chair, identified as Joshua Silva, 21, of Oakland, will be arraigned today on one felony count of assault with a deadly weapon, Assistant District Attorney Omid Talai said./></>
<2><Police>Also with a court date today is transient Michael Chapin, 28, the alleged garbage can thrower. He faces charges of felony assault with a deadly weapon and misdemeanor resisting a police officer, Talai said./></>
<2><Police>Police Commission President Thomas Mazzucco said the use of force is "inherent in making an arrest."/></>
<Useless>"The good news is, there were no debacles like Oakland or Los Angeles, or New York," Mazzucco said. "There’s no major blowups."/>
