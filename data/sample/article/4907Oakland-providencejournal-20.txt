PROVIDENCE   <Useless>As authorities moved against Occupy Wall Street offshoot/>
<Useless>encampments in other cities, Providence officials reiterated that they want an/>
<Useless>imminent, peaceful end to the Occupy Providence encampment at Burnside Park that/>
<Useless>would avoid arrests./>
<Useless>A civil preliminary injunction will be sought based on the same ordinance/>
<Useless>violations that routed homeless people who lived in a city park off Pleasant/>
<Useless>Valley Parkway in 2009, according to City Solicitor Jeffrey Padwa. That tent/>
<Useless>city was known as  Camp Runamuck./>
<Useless>The violations in this case include trespassing, remaining in the park past 9/>
<Useless>p.m. curfew and sleeping in the park overnight, Padwa said. No filing date has/>
<Useless>been set; however, Mayor Angel Taveras said Monday he expected it will be filed/>
<Useless>within a few days./>
<Useless>The city is still seeking a permanent injunction in the Camp Runamuck case, but/>
<Useless>Padwa said he believes that the preliminary injunction set a precedent for the/>
<Useless>Occupy Providence case. The Supreme Court affirmed that preliminary injunction/>
<Useless>in June./>
<Useless>We showed a trespass, and a continuing trespass,  Padwa said, and  this is the/>
<Useless>same./>
<Useless>A chambers conference that may lead to a Superior Court hearing on that/>
<Useless>permanent injunction request in the Camp Runamuck case is set for Thursday,/>
<Useless>Padwa said./>
<Useless>Occupy Providence is one of scores of grass-roots offshoots worldwide of the/>
<Useless>Occupy Wall Street movement in New York City s financial district that centers/>
<Useless>on corporate greed and economic inequality./>
<Useless>Protesters began camping overnight in Burnside Park next to Kennedy Plaza on/>
<Useless>Oct. 15. There are now more than 100 tents./>
<Useless>On Monday, facing imminent legal action, some 200 protesters marched into City/>
<Useless>Hall to request that they be allowed to stay indefinitely based on free-speech/>
<Useless>rights. They presented a letter with that request to Mayor Taveras and Public/>
<Useless>Safety Commissioner Steven M. Paré./>
<Useless>Peter G. De Simone, co-counsel for the unnamed defendants in the Camp Runamuck/>
<Useless>case, said he believes that the Occupy Providence case may involve  more serious/>
<Useless>issues of a constitutional nature./>
<Useless>(De Simone said he does not represent the Occupy Providence protesters at this/>
<Useless>time. De Simone s co-counsel, Neville Bedford, said Monday he has attended/>
<Useless>meetings with Paré and some of the protesters, but does not represent them. The/>
<Useless>group has no lawyer to date.)/>
<Useless>Any civil action the city would bring against the Occupy Providence campers/>
<Useless>would raise new issues that would not be raised in Camp Runamuck; principally/>
<Useless>the rights of assembly and free speech,  De Simone predicted.  I have no idea/>
<Useless>how those would fare at this point. I wouldn t speculate./>
Meanwhile, Paré said Tuesday that he d watched news reports of <Police>police arresting/>
<Police>Occupy Oakland protesters and dismantling their tent city in front of Oakland's/>
<Police>City Hall earlier that morning/>, and noted,  That s what we re trying to avoid. [<Camp> tent city in front of Oakland's] [City Hall] />
<Police>Oakland police in riot gear fired tear gas and beanbag rounds at around 5 a.m./>
<Police>and arrested 75 or 80 people, according to published reports. Oakland Police/>
<Police>Chief Howard Jordan said officers fired tear gas and beanbags after some/>
<Police>demonstrators hurled rocks and bottles at the police./>
It s unfortunate that they had a number of protesters that acted in that
behavior, in the response to the police,  Paré said.  It just escalates, and it
ends up getting people hurt, both police and protesters   that s how people get
hurt and that s what we re trying to avoid.
Paré added,  It s volatile. All it takes is a couple of people to become
resistant in moving off the property, and it can turn an otherwise peaceful
crowd into an aggressive crowd like we ve seen in other parts of the country.
