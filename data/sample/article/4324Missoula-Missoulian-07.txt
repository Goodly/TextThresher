Occupy Missoula: Small part of important movement
October 28, 2011 9:15 am
                                                                                                                 
                                                                
<Camp>Kelly Maier (letter, Oct. 21) writes of the "ridiculous insanity playing out on the lawn of the courthouse" and asks, "Why do a few have so much power of self expression?"/>
This "ridiculous insanity," Occupy Missoula, is a small but important part of a nationwide movement asking a better question: Why do we accept that so few have so much wealth and power that they control our government?
Examples? Legislation and loopholes that allow some corporations and wealthy people to pay almost no taxes at all; legislation to weaken protections of our air and water so companies can make more profit; bank bailouts that did nothing to help people losing their homes; state legislation that weakens workers' rights; continual imperialism, occupation and war.
I can't take enough space to list the many abuses of capitalism that have brought our country to a crisis in jobs and, at the same time, decreases social programs the poor and jobless need.
<Camp>I am proud to support Occupy Missoula, and I invite all of you who realize you are part of the "99 percent" to come down to the Courthouse lawn, read some signs and literature, talk with people, and join the next general assembly or rally (see/><Camp> www.occupymissoula.org/><Camp>)./>
<Protester>And by the way, the march Oct. 15 visited the offices of Sens. Max Baucus and Jon Tester as well as Rep. Denny Rehberg and the Wells Fargo Bank./>
