Politics different in Oklahoma

TULSA, Okla.
<Useless>"I don't say I am no better than anybody else but I'll be damned if I ain't just as good." />
<Useless>That line from the iconic Rodgers & Hammerstein musical pretty much sums up Oklahomans' character. />
<Opinionor>"It is quintessential frontier America," said Frank Keating, the state's Republican governor from 1995 to 2002. "That frontier work ethic has carried on in each generation, and so has a disdain for elites."  />
Both parties here strongly distrust anything "big" -- government, money, regulations, egos. <Useless>Although a reliably Republican state in national elections, Democrats' registration tops the GOP's -- but Oklahoma Democrats are quick to say they are not "national" Dems. />
<Useless>"I think we are different, given our background and mix of cultures," said Wallace Collins, chairman of the state's Democrats. />
<Useless>They have not changed much but the national political culture has, according to Eldon Eisenach, a retired Tulsa University political theorist. />
<Opinionor>"The Republican Party recognized the seismic shift. The Democratic Party, entrenched and isolated in liberal elite institutions, did not and they are paying the price," he said. />
<Opinionor>"Can you imagine the electoral disaster if the Democratic Party embraced Occupy Wall Street? Worse than 1968 Chicago." />
Indeed, <Camp>just 100 attended an Occupy Tulsa protest. />
<Useless>At Andale's, a South Tulsa family restaurant, Olivia Roberts waits tables full-time. Finishing a college degree, juggling is "just normal," she said, what she should do to provide for her 3-month-old daughter's future. />
<Useless>Rob Allen is up at 5 a.m. daily to shuttle people from a Tulsa hotel to the airport. Also a flight instructor and finishing a degree, too, he'd like to become a corporate-jet pilot and laughs nervously over how President Obama uses that profession as an elitist symbol. />
<Useless>As president, Obama has not visited the Sooner State; as a candidate, he attended a fundraiser here hosted by Tulsa billionaire George Kaiser in 2007. Kaiser was thrust into the national spotlight for his role in Solyndra, the taxpayer-backed solar company that went bankrupt. />
<Useless>Vice President Joe Biden was here just weeks ago, also to raise cash. Collins said Kaiser didn't attend, although Federal Election Commission records show his son, Philip, donated $5,000 at that time. />
<Useless>While Oklahomans don't affect national Democrats in the voting booth, they do donate generously to them. />
<Useless>"We send far more money to Dem candidates than is spent in the state during the presidential campaign," said Ronald Gaddie, a University of Oklahoma political science professor. />
<Useless>Sooners have not always loved Republicans; Democrats, starting with William Jennings Bryan, dominated here from 1908 until the mid-20th century. />
<Useless>Oklahoma Dems were primarily border-state immigrants with Jacksonian Democrat values. And Oklahoma politics always has been about populism and a form of moral conservatism, according to Gaddie: "This is the only state to ever come into the Union 'dry' and with half of the state population attending church at least weekly." />
<Useless>It continues to be a repository of conservative social thought. Keep government small and you keep it from encroaching on liberty, the typical Oklahoman believes. />
<Useless>So as Democrats gravitated away from providing federal dollars for state infrastructure and toward trying to "modernize" society, Oklahomans moved right. />
<Useless>Oklahoma -- terminus of the "Trail of Tears" that forcibly relocated tribal nations such as the Cherokee and Chickasaw -- maintains a rich, thriving Native American culture active in the state's political character. />
<Useless>T.W. Shannon said he breaks just about every stereotype of an elected Republican: "Let's see, I am African-American and Chickasaw." He broke two more last week when fellow state House members elected him as the state's and nation's first black Republican legislative speaker. />
<Useless>Shannon started out as a Democrat but found himself more in sync with Republicans. Yet "no matter what party people are part of in this state," he said, "everyone shares this unflinching work ethic." />
<Useless>You could see that as airport-van driver Allen cheerfully unloaded passengers. One tipped him, and he stared as she disappeared into the terminal. />
<Useless>"I was just doing my job," he said. />
