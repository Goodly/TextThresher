<Strategy>"First of all, the arrests had nothing to do with the movement," Jordan said at a news conference Wednesday. "They had to do with a violation of Tulsa ordinances and laws./>
<Strategy>"Just so you know, many of the protesters who were there were free to assemble and protest on the sidewalk without being in the park after curfew," Jordan said./>
<Government>H.A. Chapman Centennial Green, like all city parks, has an 11 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew that officials decided on Tuesday to begin enforcing./>
<Police>Jordan said/><Strategy> the police department supported the movement's right to lawfully and peacefully assemble, and would even protect the group if they came under threats./>
<Camp>Several of those who bonded out of the county jail and returned to the park Wednesday/><Strategy> felt differently./>
<Strategy>"They came out to do us harm, they came out it seems to do us violence. You don't need 50 officers for this," said /><Camp>Eli Silva, 23, of Tulsa,/><Strategy> who had been arrested. Silva said he was blinded for about an hour by the pepper spray that left an orange stain on his white hoodie, and he said he was keeping it on "as a badge of honor."/>
<Useless>[DUPLICATE]/>
<Useless>Samuel Molik, 24, of Tulsa, said he was arrested when a group of the protesters formed a circle in the park, interlocking their arms./>
<Useless>"It's a hard feeling to describe, it's still so fresh. I'm disappointed. I'm slightly disgusted by what's happened here," he said./>
<Useless>Amanda Hammack, 29, of Tulsa bore several cuts and a large bruise that she said were caused by zip ties used to handcuff her./>
<Useless>"I just went limp, I didn't fight. They pulled me off the ground, carried me out of the park and put me face down on the cement./>
<Useless>"I feel very angry and frustrated by it, but I feel like now, more than ever, that this movement is going to change the world," she said./>
<Useless>Three tents were in place at the park Wednesday morning and the protesters said they planned to occupy the space again Wednesday night. Some passers-by provided the group with support, as one man in business suit stopped to hand Silva a $20 bill./>
<Useless>"That's for a great protest," the man said and walked away./>
<Useless>Someone else had delivered a pile of sweatshirts for the protesters to wear in the crisp weather./>
<Useless>In Oklahoma City, where protesters are camping at a city park, there have been no arrests, said Beth Isbell, who described herself as a moderator for Occupy Oklahoma City./>
<Useless>"We're a little less concerned about that in Oklahoma City. We have a permit at Kerr Park and we have an agreement with police and we have been cooperating with police," she said./>
