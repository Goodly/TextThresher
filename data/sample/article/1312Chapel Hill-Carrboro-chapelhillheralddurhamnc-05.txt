CHAPEL HILL ? <Protester>As Occupy Chapel Hill moved from the Peace and Justice Plaza down to Greenbridge Development and back on Thursday night, they were accompanied by the presence of blue lights./>
<Protester>The crowd marched approximately 120 people strong,/> echoing chants including <Opinionor>"Streets of Chapel Hill beware, Zuccotti Park is everywhere," and "Up with the streets, down with the walls." Expletives were sprinkled in a few, followed by chants of "Freedom of speech."/>
<Protester>Occupy Chapel Hill/Carrboro organized the Solidarity March./> Liz Reeves, a Chapel Hill resident who has been involved with the group since its creation, said though the turnout was larger than previous events, she wasn't satisfied.
"We can never have enough people," she said.
But, <Camp>more people have been attending the group's daily general assembly meetings />following <Useless>a week of Occupy conflict both on the local and national level./> <Protester>Thursday's march began after that evening's meeting./>
<Useless>Early Tuesday, police in New York City emptied Zuccotti Park of its Occupy Wall Street protestors, sparking questions of censorship and police brutality./>
<ToBe>Seven protestors, some of whom had been involved with the Occupy movement, were arrested Sunday on misdemeanor counts of breaking and entering the former Yates Company Motors building on West Franklin Street./> <Camp>Occupy Chapel Hill/Carrboro reaches consensus in its assembly before making any collective actions, and these individuals had not been given consensus./> But as <ToBe>guns were wielded,/> <Useless>the same questions were raised in Chapel Hill that are being asked of police presence in New York./>
<Useless>"What happened in Zuccotti Park this week made me furious, and I figured this was the night to come out and do something,"/> said Drew Lindberg. The march was the first event he's participated in with the Occupy movement.
<Protester>The group marched down Franklin Street, and looped around on Rosemary, walking in front of and around cars./>
Jeremy Westland, a former Chapel Hill resident, had been protesting with Occupy Santa Fe for a month before coming to North Carolina to get involved with Occupy UNC-Greensboro, where he used to be a student. But after seeing the weekend's events, he was inspired to support Chapel Hill's group.
<Opinionor>"I think the police cracking down on occupations across the country is building them up more and driving the movement," he said. "People are beginning to see that this is a police state."/>
The front of the march included some of those arrested Sunday.
<Strategy>Jeff Clark, Chapel Hill Police Captain, said the police's presence was due to the safety concerns of a large march occurring after dark and disturbing traffic. /><Protester>In addition to the normal downtown officers, the police employed three additional cars for traffic control, />Clark said.
<Protester>"The event went well; the crowd generally stayed on the sidewalks,"/> Clark said. <2><Strategy>"As long as we get through without any injuries, it's a success. Tonight was very successful."/></>
<3><Strategy>Reeves said she believes the police presence was largely due to the fact that the break-in occurred after the group's last march, which she witnessed./></>
<4><Strategy>"After being held at gunpoint, I don't think the police are worried about my safety," she said/></>.
<Useless>A march that is not directly related to Occupy Chapel Hill/Carrboro will be held 6 p.m. Monday starting from the Chapel Hill Police Department and going to the Town Council meeting, which will protest police brutality in response to the movements./>
