<Useless>The anniversary of the death of Oakland literary scion Jack London is just about/>
<Useless>here. The 40-year-old writer died 95 years ago, on Nov. 22, 1916, at his ranch/>
<Useless>in Glen Ellen./>
<Useless>Over the course of his brief yet adventure-packed life, he achieved/>
<Useless>international fame and produced over 50 books, hundreds of short stories and/>
<Useless>numerous articles on a wide range of topics. Born in San Francisco, he grew up/>
<Useless>primarily in Oakland./>
<Useless>Sometimes called "the boy socialist," London articulated the aspirations and/>
<Useless>dreams of his fellow working-class comrades, his biographers assert. He was/>
<Useless>largely self-taught, having started and stopped his formal education at various/>
<Useless>times. As a radicalized teen, London was known to frequent City Hall Plaza and/>
<Useless>make speeches; during that period in the 1890s, the country was experiencing a/>
<Useless>prolonged depression and many people were out of work./>
<Useless>Two city landmarks are directly associated with Jack London's life in Oakland --/>
<Useless>the iconic Heinold's First and Last Chance Saloon, in the heart of the/>
<Useless>waterfront district named for him, and a modest Queen Anne cottage on Foothill/>
<Useless>Boulevard in the San Antonio neighborhood in East Oakland./>
<Useless>In 1898, London's mother, Flora, was renting the two-bedroom raised basement/>
<Useless>cottage, with fruit trees in the back yard. She agreed to take in her/>
<Useless>then-22-year-old son after his 16-month adventure prospecting in the Klondike/>
<Useless>Territory. As readers of his stories know, the experience in the wilderness was/>
<Useless>incredibly grueling. London came home suffering from scurvy and without the/>
<Useless>riches he had hoped for./>
<Useless>While he might not have made a fortune, he did have a storehouse of experiences/>
<Useless>to draw upon, and while living in his mother's cottage, London began writing, up/>
<Useless>to 1,000 words a day, six days a week, while working various odd jobs to support/>
<Useless>the family. He considered taking a job at the post office, paying $65 a month,/>
<Useless>but then a magazine bought one of his stories and London never looked back./>
<Useless>Carol Brookman, longtime proprietor of the First and Last Chance, has done her/>
<Useless>best to keep the onetime oyster fishermen bunkhouse-turned-saloon from the 1880s/>
<Useless>just as Johnny Heinold, Jack London's friend, left it. Brookman took over the/>
<Useless>place 30 years ago from members of Heinold's family. The planks from the old/>
<Useless>frame building came from a whaling vessel; the pot belly stove is still the only/>
<Useless>source of heat. The floor slopes down, sagging since its pilings sank in the mud/>
<Useless>back in the 1906 earthquake and the clock on the wall is stuck on the time, 5:18/>
<Useless>a.m. that the quake struck. The walls are covered with memorabilia and faded/>
<Useless>photographs./>
<Useless>Readers know the First and Last Chance is mentioned several times in London's/>
<Useless>writings. A plaque by the door reveals that, in addition to being a city/>
<Useless>landmark, the establishment is a National Literary Landmark as well./>
<Useless>After London's death in 1916, Oakland Mayor John Davie (who claimed to be/>
<Useless>London's bosom friend and drinking companion) ordered a young live oak tree/>
<Useless>sapling be planted in City Hall Plaza in London's memory. At a solemn ceremony/>
<Useless>with London's wife, Charmian, in attendance, the task was carried out./>
<Useless>Today, 95 years later, the mature live oak spreads its branches low to the/>
ground. What would Jack London think of <ToBe>Occupy Oakland demonstrators under his/>
<ToBe>tree [ in City Hall Plaza ]/>? <Opinionor>Oakland tour guide Lisa Hire thinks she knows: "He would have been out/>
<Opinionor>here with the demonstrators," she believes. "Economic justice was extremely/>
<Opinionor>important to him."/>
