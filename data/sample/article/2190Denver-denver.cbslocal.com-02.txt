Denver’s New Police Chief Puts Occupy Denver On Notice
DENVER (CBS4) – <Police>Denver’s new police chief put Occupy Denver on notice Monday/> — his patience has run out.
<Legal_Action>Chief Robert White met with protesters for almost an hour,/><Police> telling them they need to remove their stuff from /><Police>Civic/><Police>Center Park or the city will./>
<2><Police>It was the chief’s second warning/></>, and it is clearly his last. <Strategy>He didn’t say when or how the stuff will be removed, only that he won’t compromise. That didn’t make Occupy Denver very /><Strategy>happy/>.
<Legal_Action>Ten members of Occupy Denver got 45 minutes with White in a meeting that happened behind closed doors and ended with neither side budging./>
<Camp>Civic Center Park has been trashed. The new sod has been trampled and the sandstone is covered in graffiti. There are makeshift shelters and a kayak in a tree/>.
<Legal_Action>On Thursday the chief told protesters himself they could stay, but the “encumbrances” had to go. He was greeted with contempt and profanity./>
Occupy Denver took video of the meeting and posted it on YouTube.
<Legal_Action>“Productive to the point where I think I understood their position and I think they understand the city’s position,” White said./>
<Legal_Action>“I don’t think it was very productive,” a protester said./>
<Strategy>“So I don’t want to get into the strategies of how that’s going to occur, but will tell you it is going to occur,” White said./>
<Strategy>He said he’s given ample warning./>
<Strategy>“I think it would be in all of our best interests to avoid any confrontation,” White said./>
While protestors said they wouldn’t resist, they also won’t help.
“You know we were hoping to have more of a creative conversation but it’s the same old; the state says encumbrances must go,” the protester said.
It’s not just government saying that. <Camp>There’s now an online petition drive urging the city to “liberate the park.” Since Sunday 194 people have signed it. />Most of them have voiced sentiments like Kendall Peterson, who wrote, “I support the Occupy movement and its core principals. The destruction of public property and century-old art is not helping their cause. It is illegal vandalism pure and simple.”
The Civic Center Conservancy, a nonprofit set up to restore the park, put the petition together. Every time someone signs it, it generates anemail to the city and Mayor Michael Hancock.
