TAMPA, Fla. - It's something we've been keeping an eye on since the seasonal ice rink in downtown Tampa opened last month. <Camp>Organizers with the ice rink have been curious how Occupy Tampa protesters would affect attendance, since the two are only about 50 yards apart./>
Organizers recently pulled updated attendance records and were shocked to see the numbers. Last year, which was the first year for the ice rink, 20,000 people came out to skate. This year, attendance is down.
"We're guessing by about 30 percent to 37 percent," said Kitty Lyons, Executive Director of Friends of Tampa Recreation, which is the charitable arm of Tampa's Parks and Recreation Department.  
Lyons showed ABC Action News spreadsheets that stated while 5,400 people had visited the ice rink by this time last year, only 3,400 have come out to skate as of now.
"I feel it's the Occupy Tampa out front," Lyons said. "It's unsettling for some people to go through that to get to the tent."
Most people don't realize the not-for-profit Friends of Tampa Recreation backs the ice rink.<Camp> Lyons said ultimately the drop in attendance and revenue is a loss for the city's kids and the Parks and Recreation Department. /><Government>[Lyons said ultimately the drop in attendance and revenue is a loss for the city's kids and the Parks and Recreation Department.]/>
Lyons said the not-for-profit sponsors scholarships and youth programs throughout the year and now they will have to reevaluate how they allocate money.
<Camp>Occupy Tampa maintains they are advocates for non-profits and small businesses./>
<Camp>"I don't think we should inhibit anyone. We are peaceful. You can see it's only six people at a table. That shouldn't discourage people from ice skating," said Occupy protester Joe Jay./>
There is no way to tell for certain if the drop in attendance at the ice rink is because of its Occupy Tampa neighbors.
Regardless, organizers with the ice rink are going out of their way to get your business. The rink will be open extended hours for the last two weeks of December from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
There is a watch party scheduled for Thursday night for the Tampa Bay Lightning away game.
"Tampa police are here. It's safe. We have security in the park until 10 p.m.," Lyons said.
The city of Tampa is the main sponsor of the ice rink. <Strategy>Mayor Bob Buckhorn said there is nothing the city can do at this point./>
<Strategy>He said it's a balancing act of protecting first amendment rights and encouraging growth for small businesses and non-profit organizations./>
