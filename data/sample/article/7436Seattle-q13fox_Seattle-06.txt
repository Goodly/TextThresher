Occupy Seattle calls for supporters to break up with their banks
Nationally, the movement is calling for supporters to move to community banks, credit unions
SEATTLE—
<Protester>Occupy Seattle held a rally in support of National Bank Transfer Day at Westlake Park at 1 p.m. Saturday. />The Occupy movement asked supporters to close their bank accounts at commercial banks and open accounts at community-based banks and credit unions.
<Opinionor>"We can't let the fox watch the henhouse anymore," activist Susan Wilkinson said. "They don't self-police and they don't behave responsibly."/>
<Protester>A number of supporters went into the downtown Seattle Chase bank to close their accounts. The group marched in a peaceful and orderly way. Police were present and officers did not need to intercede with the group/>.
<Opinionor>Many of the protesters who transferred banks as part of the event knew for a long time beforehand that they would be making a change, but needed the motivation./>
<Opinionor>"I didn't have the energy to change and go through all of the paperwork, but as I started becoming more politically aware, I got the energy," Wilkinson said./>
<Opinionor>A large part of the Occupy movement has focused its criticism on large banks that many supporters believe are responsible for the current downturn. Citing the bank's "corporate greed" and role in the uptick in home foreclosures that have occurred over the course of the past few years, Occupy supporters believe that physically moving their monetary assets will send a message to the banks./>
<Opinionor>The message they are sending to banks is succinct: "It's not me, it's you," Amelia Vasser said. She took part because of the national movement./>
<Opinionor>"I've seen them chargee me ridiculous fees, re-arrange transactions so they could charge me the most amount in overdraft things," Vasser said. "I have no complaint with my branch, the complaint is with corporate arrogance, the complaint is with corporate Chase."/>
<Camp>On their website/>, Occupy Seattle<Opinionor> posted that the group “believes that we need to support financial institutions, like local banks and credit unions, that invest in our communities, make loans to small businesses, and help create jobs. There is no reason to continue doing business with the Wall Street banks that crashed the economy and have done little to help the nation recover. Every dollar we take back goes towards building a new bottom line that means good jobs and healthy communities.”/>
<Protester>Today's rally included performances by singer Jim Page, the trip-hop group Surrealized, America’s Got Talent alum Jen Seaman and comedians Travis Simmons and Nigel Larson./>
