AMP is an alternative that lets nonviolent offenders pay a fine and costs and perform community service to avoid trial and possibly get their arrest record expunged.
<Police>The 32 in court Tuesday were arrested between 1:15 and 5:45 a.m. last Wednesday: one at 15th Street and John F. Kennedy Boulevard, five at 15th and Market Streets, and 26 right before dawn at 1500 Hamilton St. in the Spring Garden section./>
According to the District Attorney's Office, 13 of the 32 accepted entry into AMP and agreed to perform 12 hours of community service and pay $199.50 in fines and court costs.

Paul J. Hetznecker, a Center City civil rights lawyer who is also part of the Occupy defense team, said that <Info>Municipal Court had set aside three days - Dec. 13, 20, and 30 - to handle the remaining 20 protesters />from <Protester>the 52 arrested last Wednesday./>
Hetznecker said<Info> he expected the trials to examine the conflict between the First Amendment rights of free speech and assembly and police use of disorderly-conduct and failure-to-disperse ordinances to arrest and end peaceful protests./>
In another protest Tuesday, five of 30 people from the environmental group Earth Quaker Action Team, who staged a morning protest in the lobby of the PNC Bank building at 16th and Market Streets, were arrested for refusing to leave the building.
Ingrid Lakey, the group's director, said the demonstration was to publicize alternatives to fossil fuels and protest PNC's financing of companies that practice mountaintop-removal coal mining in West Virginia.
