<Protester>A dozen progressives, led  part way by Richmond Mayor Gayle McLaughlin, on/>
<Protester>Wednesday marched from Richmond to downtown Oakland in support of Occupy Oakland/>
<Protester>and the general strike./>
"It was absolutely worth it," Marilyn Langlois, an aide to McLaughlin, said of
the roughly 10-mile trek. "There was a lot of support along the way."
The marchers were mostly members of the Richmond Progressive Alliance and
carried a banner that read "Occupy Oakland." It took more than three hours,
marching along San Pablo Avenue, to reach the strike's epicenter at Frank H.
Ogawa Plaza.
McLaughlin walked through Richmond with the group before returning to city
business.
<Protester>"We are marching in solidarity with the Occupy Oakland movement./> We stand for
the 99 percent that the system is failing,"<Opinionor> McLaughlin said Wednesday morning./>
<Opinionor>McLaughlin also took a verbal poke at her Oakland counterpart, Jean Quan/>, for
allowing <Police>Oakland's police department to forcefully roust protesters last week, a/>
<Police>clash that made international headlines./>
"We really are at a crossroads here. As an elected official, you need to know
which side you are on, or you will get caught in the intersection, as Jean Quan
did," McLaughlin said.
The Richmond mayor and other progressives said the widening gulf between rich
and poor, both in terms of money and influence, frustrates most Americans.
"In Richmond, we have two prominent representatives of the 1 percent," said Juan
Reardon, of the Richmond Progressive Alliance. "We have banks, and we have
Chevron."
The march began at Macdonald and San Pablo avenues, an intersection that
features a Chevron station and two branches of large national banks. Protesters
unfurled a large Occupy Chevron banner to accompany their Occupy Oakland banner
before setting off.
"This is where the '60s and '70s left off," McLaughlin said as she walked. "This
is the next step. They're honking and waving because they know what this is
about. This is the real thing."
