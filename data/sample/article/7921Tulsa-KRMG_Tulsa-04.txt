TULSA, Okla. — Members of the Occupy Tulsa movement seemed to take a step toward scaling back their acts of civil disobedience<Police> Saturday night,/> as no one chose to go to jail.
However, <Police>six of the protesters did voluntarily remain on the grass at the Centennial Green downtown long enough to receive citations from police. />[<Camp>Centennial Green downtown/>]<Strategy> [/><Strategy>six of the protesters did voluntarily remain on the grass at the Centennial Green downtown long enough to receive citations from police./>]

TPD, meanwhile, has scaled back its response after an initial confrontation which involved the use of pepper spray and the deployment of dozens of officers, perhaps as many as 75 or 80.
The Occupy Tulsa movement says it will remain in place, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in an effort to get its message across to the public.
