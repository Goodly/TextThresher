<Government>Last night we got word that /><Government>the city is invalidating Occupy Dallas's permit to stay in Pioneer Park/><Government> till 5 p.m./> <Government>Friday, since the group hadn't secured the million-dollar insurance policy City Hall demanded on Monday./> [<Camp>the city is invalidating Occupy Dallas's permit to stay in Pioneer Park till 5 p.m. Friday, since the group hadn't secured the million-dollar insurance policy City Hall demanded on Monday.]/> The question was: Would the city kick Occupy Dallas out at <Government>11 p.m., the park curfew,/> or let them remain so long as they stayed in their tents and kept quiet, which is what Schutze was told when he left last night? The latter, turns out -- so far, at least.


Before the overnight rain moved in, <Camp>the great Justin Terveen/><Camp> stopped by the park near City Hall to see what was (or wasn't) happening. He was there twice: 'round midnight, then again at 4:30 a.m./>, when the downtown sky was illuminated with the flashes of lightning you see forming in the photo above. Early this morning he sent me the shots; on the other side, a few more looks at the tent city next door to the new Omni Hotel.
