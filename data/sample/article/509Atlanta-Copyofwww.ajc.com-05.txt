Retired Atlanta criminal defense attorney <Opinionor>Brooks Franklin was one of six attorneys volunteering his time to help protesters Sunday. Franklin, who is now an organic farmer in North Carolina, decided to return Sunday morning to the city where he practiced law for more than 35 years./>
<Opinionor>"I got up at 2 a.m. this morning to support these young people," said Brooks. "Things are worse off then they've ever been. Things are just not in sync."/>
<Opinionor>Like many of the protesters, he said he's disgusted by "money-driven" politics and the inequities between rich and the poor./>
<Opinionor>"People with money are ruling the world," he said./>
<Opinionor>Just a few feet away from Brooks, Occupy Atlanta supporters carried homemade signs that said, "I'm here because I believe we can do better! We don't need to leave the 99 percent behind."/>

They included an instructor at Georgia State University and a man who works in video production. They also included a young man who said he was simply leaving a restaurant after a late-night snack when he got caught up in the commotion and was then arrested.

<Protester>Just before midnight, waves of Atlanta police began moving south down Peachtree, forcing the marchers back. The first rank of police was simply in uniform and carried plastic handcuffs. They were backed by officers in riot gear — face plates, body armor and long nightsticks — and mounted police./>
<Protester>A knot of protesters chanted “Shame! Shame! Shame!” as the police advanced./>

<Government>The mayor’s office said Thursday that the first occupation of the park cost city taxpayers more than $451,000, most of it in police overtime./>
