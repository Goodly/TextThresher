BOSTON —<Protester>A group called Occupy Boston took over Dewey Square in Boston Friday night holding a 60s-style sit in./>
<Opinionor>"It doesn’t look like the politicians are serving the people any more," said John, a protestor who would only give his first name. "They’re serving people with money."/>
This is part of nationwide movement that began with a large protest last week on Wall Street.
<Opinionor>"We're talking about government reform. We’re talking about finance reform," said Nadeem Mazen, from Occupy Boston. "And we’re opening up a national dialogue as part of a really big issue that’s on so many people’s minds."/>
A few blocks away a group called Take Back Boston lead hundreds of people marching from Boston Common to the Financial District.
At 100 Federal Street the protesters gathered at both entrances to the Bank of America building shouting "We got sold out." The crowd included dozens of families facing foreclosure.
"The bank took over my property. Tried to evict everybody," said Mallerrie McCoy of Dorchester. "They boarded up my windows. They changed our locks. I?m here to say i?m not going anywhere."
Antonio Ennis is facing foreclosure on his Dorchester home.
"All we?re asking for is reduce the principal. It?s what?s right," Ennis said. "They got bailed out by us. We need help now. "
Some 24 protesters were arrested taken from the building in plastic handcuffs as the crowd cheered them on.
"A group went up and purposefully blocked the doors and we asked them to leave," said Police Commissioner Ed Davis. "When they said they didn?t want to and they wanted to be arrested we obliged."
These individuals choose to ignore the facts and instead focus on increasingly aggressive PR stunts, Bank of America spokesman T.J.Crawford said.
Bank of America has a lot to be proud of in Massachusetts, from modifying 18,000 mortgages since 2008, to lending nearly $400 million to small businesses that are fueling the local economy in the first half of 2011.
