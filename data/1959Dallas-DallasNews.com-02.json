        "text": "Occupy Dallas moves protest hub to downtown\u2019s Pegasus Park but won\u2019t camp there\nBy ROY APPLETON\nStaff Writer\nrappleton@dallasnews.com \nPublished: 22 November 2011 11:24 PM\n\n\nDays after police ended their stay near City Hall, Occupy Dallas members are moving to a more prominent base of protests \u2014 in the heart of downtown.\nThey don\u2019t plan to camp, but to maintain a 24-hour presence in and near Pegasus Park, beginning Wednesday.\n\u201cThe park will provide constant exposure in a high-traffic area,\u201d protest leader Michael Prestonise wrote in a proposal approved unanimously by the group\u2019s general assembly Monday night. The park, at the intersection of Main and Akard streets, \u201cis the best choice for a new location to optimize the public visibility of our movement.\u201d\nHotels, restaurants and lofts surround the park. Twenty-three Occupy Dallas demonstrators were arrested last month for blocking the entrance to a Chase bank nearby.\nThe influence of and prospects for the Occupy Movement here and elsewhere are unclear. For now, the local plan puts protesters at Pegasus Park between 5 a.m. to 11 p.m., when it is open to the public. And it has them walking sidewalks nearby when the park is closed overnight.\n\u201cThe city of Dallas will have no grounds for our removal so long as we maintain presence in the park (during legal hours) and then continue on the sidewalk after hours,\u201d Prestonise wrote in the proposal.\nBut attorney Jonathan Winocour told the group Monday night that the city might try to enforce ordinances, such as limits on noise and a prohibition against attracting a crowd on a sidewalk by \u201cloud talking, unusual acts or exhibitions.\u201d\nWinocour also urged the group to respect the park property, to avoid damaging trees or littering. \u201cIf you are going to occupy the space, treat it as your home,\u201d he said.\nInspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement, the local protesters have delivered wide-ranging messages decrying corporate greed, the widening wealth gap and a political system they say is corrupt and unresponsive to all but the powerful.\nSince the first Occupy Dallas demonstration Oct. 6, police and other city officials have said they respect and will protect the protesters\u2019 rights to free speech and assembly as long as they don\u2019t violate city laws.\nThe city gave the group a permit to camp at Pioneer Plaza and then let the protesters temporarily settle near City Hall on Oct. 17 with conditions, such as no fires, cooking, signs or toilets at the site.\nCiting violations and health and safety concerns at the camp, the city rescinded the agreement last Wednesday. And early Thursday, more than 100 police officers, some in riot gear, stepped in, removing tents and arresting 18 people without resistance. The misdemeanor charge: occupying an area closed to the public between midnight and 5 a.m. The fine: $184.\nThe loss of the campsite shouldn\u2019t be a setback for the group, said Dr. Lloyd Jeff Dumas, a professor of political economy, economics and public policy at the University of Texas at Dallas.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t have to be sleeping in a park to make a difference,\u201d he said.",
