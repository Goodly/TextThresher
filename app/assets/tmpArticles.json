        "text": "'Occupy Atlanta' rallies at Capitol\nATLANTA — \n\nProtesters who have been camped out in a downtown Atlanta park for more than a week left their posts for the state Capitol on Saturday. They are demanding jobs.\nOccupy Atlanta protesters chanted for change as they made the mile-long journey from Woodruff Park on Peachtree Street to the state Capitol on Washington Street. The Beatles song “Revolution” was playing at their destination. Demonstrators said they want jobs, not cuts to government programs.\n“This march is specifically to support the unions and support they need for more investments in jobs and less cuts in Georgia,\" protester Natalie Stohl told Channel 2’s Sophia Choi.\nAfter the march, demonstrators headed back to Woodruff Park. The city initially said they had to pack up their tents and leave the park by Monday, but Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said Friday that deadline is not firm. He said he may allow them to stay longer, but not indefinitely.\nDemonstrators said they plan to stay until they see change from the government.\n“We know that come Monday, we're committed to non-violence, but we're also committed to occupy this park,” protester Tim Franzen said.\nProtesters plan to hold a non-violence seminar at Woodruff Park on Sunday, so everyone will know how to handle themselves if police try to kick them out."
