Andrew Cuomo has had state police enforce an 11 p.m. curfew in adjacent Lafayette Park, where more than 130 people have been arrested.\nThe city's chief lawyer told protesters in a letter almost three weeks ago they could stay until Dec 22 under a permit limiting them to 30 tents. It included other conditions with which they have complied. Officials say their concern is the cold. Talks have continued.\nSome protesters say they won't leave, with a rally planned Thursday evening.\n \nLOAD-DATE: December 23, 2011\nLANGUAGE: ENGLISH\nPUBLICATION-TYPE: Newswire\nCopyright 2011 Associated Press\nAll Rights Reserved",
