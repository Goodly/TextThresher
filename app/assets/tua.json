        "text": "Santa Cruz city attorney sues Occupy campers for nuisance\nBy Stephen Baxter\nPosted:   11\/12\/2011 01:30:34 AM PST\n\n\nSANTA CRUZ -- Santa Cruz city attorneys have filed a lawsuit against Occupy Santa Cruz to cease being a public nuisance at San Lorenzo Park, where demonstrators have been camping since Oct. 8.\nJudge Timothy Volkmann is expected to rule Wednesday whether the city's injunction served Thursday will be granted to cease what deputy city attorneys calls a nuisance in the park. Deputy City Attorney Caio Arellano named Occupy Santa Cruz legal team member Steve Pleich in the suit as well as 100 John Does.\nPleich, who said he does not speak for the group, said he would help argue the group's case in court.\n\"I'm going to be defending myself to the fullest extent of the law,\" Pleich said Friday. \"We could abate the nuisance without leaving the park.\"\nDeputies served a handful of citations for lodging to the camp early Friday morning.\nMayor Ryan Coonerty said Friday that the lawsuit was filed in part because park workers and park users have complained about problems in the camp.\n\"Most of the complaints are coming from county workers who are seeing feces, drug use and other illegal activities happening,\" Coonerty said. \"They want us to take action.\"\nSanta Cruz police also reported that a camper punched a county parks worker in the face Nov. 2 after the worker's leaf blower woke him early that morning. The man was arrested on suspicion of assault, Deputy Chief Steve Clark said.\nOn Nov. 4, city officials gave Occupy leaders a permit for the demonstration, which was not requested by the demonstrators. It ordered the activists to disband the campsite by noon Wednesday and clarified other rules of the park that addressed trash, toilets and other issues.\nDozens of the city's homeless have been drawn to the park not necessarily as a political statement but because they are often not ticketed for lodging or illegal camping, authorities said.\n\"What I hear from most residents is that they overwhelmingly support the Occupy cause -- as does the City Council -- but we're just worried about the health and safety impacts on the park. Every other group in Santa Cruz who holds an event like this has a permit and has conditions, so we're just asking the same from this group,\" Coonerty said.\nThe Occupy Santa Cruz group formed as an echo of the Occupy Wall Street protest in New York that opposes national bank bailouts and economic disparities countrywide.\nCoonerty said City Council members discussed the lawsuit this week.\nVice Mayor Don Lane and other city officials have discussed the camping problems with Occupy leaders several times to try to iron out an agreement for the camp to end when the permit ends on Wednesday.\nCoonerty said city leaders are trying to avoid a \"showdown\" with Occupy campers and a forced withdrawal.\nOne rule in the permit required the demonstrators to provide three portable restrooms in parking spots on Ocean Street. There is one portable restroom there now, Pleich said.\nThe leaderless Occupy Santa Cruz \"general assembly\" has not yet decided whether to add more toilets, he said.",
