{"article_id":203, "Topic Text" : "DENVER - Occupy Denver planned to hold a dance and march to mark the one year anniversary of the Occupy movement's start in New York. On Monday, Occupy supporters planned what they called a foreclosure dance outside the Wells Fargo bank on the 16th Street Mall in Denver. Supporters were invited to join in from noon to the close of business. Protesters then planned to march to Civic Center Park for what they called an after-party event from 6 to 11 p.m. Despite clashes with police last year, the Colorado State Patrol and Denver Police said they did not plan to add an extra staff at the park Monday night. While the Occupy Denver movement has not been as visible lately, members say they're still very busy. It's becoming more of an organized entity, said Corrine Fowler. They're meeting weekly, they have teach-ins on many different social justice issues, they have a number of different committees, they're fundraising. Just because you don't see them pounding the pavement demanding change, they're in there working on it, Fowler explained." ,

After the governor ordered the park closed, protesters and officers clashed on October 14 when officers moved in to remove the tents. Two dozen people were arrested. The protests continued throughout the winter with a handful of members of Occupy Denver living on the sidewalk next to Civic Center Park on Broadway between Colfax and 14th avenues. Then in March, the area had to be cleared out after one of the inhabitants told authorities he had scabies. In May, the city of Denver banned unauthorized camping in the city.",
